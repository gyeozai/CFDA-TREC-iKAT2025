Notes: If you notice that your acid reflux is worsening, discontinue this home remedy.\nUSER: Why does it happen? Does it have a reason?\nSYSTEM: Acid reflux is a condition that occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter (LES)--a muscle between the stomach and esophagus-- malfunctions, allowing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus. This can cause a burning sensation in your heart and chest, which we often refer to as \"heartburn.\" Over time, prolonged acid reflux can cause damage to the esophagus and potentially lead to the chronic form of the condition called GERD. Acid reflux happens due to improper functioning of the LES. Acid reflux normally happens when we eat certain foods that stimulate excess acid production; however, for some people, genetics plays a role in reflux. Eating large meals, lying down straight after eating, or snacking close to bedtime are also common triggers of reflux. Being overweight means that you are more likely to suffer from reflux because of increased pressure on your stomach, which can force open the valve after a meal. Some people find that acid reflux is worse when they are stressed. Acid reflux also happens due to a weakness of the sphincter muscle, or when the stomach produces too much acid and not enough protective mucus. There is also something called a hiatus hernia; due to a gap in the diaphragm, parts of the stomach can move into the chest, which increases the risk of reflux.",

Try to eat your dinner earlier because eating too late in the evening and going to bed after a big dinner is well known for causing acid reflux symptoms. If you are overweight, you are more likely to suffer from acid reflux symptoms. Losing some weight, taking some exercise, and adopting a healthier lifestyle may help reduce symptoms. Don't eat fruits like mango, pomegranate, and kiwi because they are not good for acid reflux.\nUSER: Cider vinegar? Isn't it acidic?\nSYSTEM: It might seem counter-productive to add more acid to your already struggling system, but apple cider vinegar can make you feel so much better. Sometimes acid reflux can be caused by a lack of acid or lower amounts of acid in your system. Adding a bit of acidic apple cider vinegar can stop these problems before they occur. Combine 3 tsps or 1 tablespoon of raw, unfiltered, apple cider vinegar with 6-8 ounces of fresh water and drink before a meal. You can repeat before each meal or even 3-4 times throughout the day. Notes: If you notice that your acid reflux is worsening, discontinue this home remedy.\nUSER: Why does it happen? Does it have a reason?\nSYSTEM: Acid reflux is a condition that occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter (LES)--a muscle between the stomach and esophagus-- malfunctions, allowing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus. This can cause a burning sensation in your heart and chest, which we often refer to as \"heartburn.\" Over time, prolonged acid reflux can cause damage to the esophagus and potentially lead to the chronic form of the condition called GERD. Acid reflux happens due to improper functioning of the LES. Acid reflux normally happens when we eat certain foods that stimulate excess acid production; however, for some people, genetics plays a role in reflux. Eating large meals, lying down straight after eating, or snacking close to bedtime are also common triggers of reflux. Being overweight means that you are more likely to suffer from reflux because of increased pressure on your stomach, which can force open the valve after a meal. Some people find that acid reflux is worse when they are stressed. Acid reflux also happens due to a weakness of the sphincter muscle, or when the stomach produces too much acid and not enough protective mucus. There is also something called a hiatus hernia; due to a gap in the diaphragm, parts of the stomach can move into the chest, which increases the risk of reflux.\nUSER: I have a deadline approaching. Could that be related? Are there any ODC medications?\nSYSTEM: Sorry to hear that, yes it could certainly be a reason for your problem. There are specific types of medicines to help treat acid reflux. These include a class of medicines called proton pump inhibitors. Some examples of PPIs available over-the-counter include: Esomeprazole, Omeprazole, and Lansoprazole. There's also a type of medication called H2 blockers available over-the-counter to help with acid reflux. These include: Cimetidine, Famotidine, Nizatidine, and Ranitidine.\nUSER: How are these two compared?\nSYSTEM: H2 blockers are less expensive and seem to be safer than the PPI medications. In a 2016 study led by Dr. Morgan Grams of Johns Hopkins University, people who use PPIs are more likely to develop chronic kidney disease compared to those who take other types of heartburn medication.",

If you do experience heartburn or acid reflux from mangoes, it is probably best to avoid the fruit altogether.

Join a local sport league for adults or take part in a walking or running club in your neighbourhood. Rotate your commute. Take every chance you can to walk or bike instead of drive, whether it is to work, to the store or to a friend's house. Move around at work. Instead of sitting in your desk chair the whole day through, stand up or sit on an exercise ball.\nUSER: Sure, I know these can help, but what can practically help me?\nSYSTEM: Here are some practical steps. Take a 20-30-minute walk, jog, or do a home workout. Aim for at least 8 hours of quality sleep each night. Target 11-16 cups of water a day. Spend time in fresh air and sunlight. Even 10-15 minutes can boost your mood. Take a few minutes daily to breathe deeply or try simple meditation. Say no to alcohol, tobacco, and drugs. Cut down on caffeine if needed. In your case, to maintain a healthier lifestyle, I would recommend avoiding eating too much out and too late.\nUSER: Psychological\nSYSTEM: Mental health is about maintaining a positive, balanced mindset and responding well to life challenges.

The sulphur compounds in garlic support your digestive system, which is important for overall health and weight management. Regular garlic consumption can increase your metabolism, helping your body burn more calories for energy. Garlic is nutrient-dense (rich in vitamins B6, C, manganese, selenium, etc.) and very low in calories, so it's easy to include in your meals without adding excess energy. Although garlic is associated with many health benefits, a few studies suggest it may increase the likelihood of heartburn in people with acid reflux - especially raw garlic. So be extra cautious when adding it to your diet.",

If you brew these beans, you'll end up with sour coffee.\nUSER: Tell me about different ones.\nSYSTEM: Sure, are you looking for non-sour coffee beans?\nUSER: No, I am asking generally.\nSYSTEM: There are four different types of coffee beans in the world. 1) Arabica makes up most coffee grown at present, accounting for about 60% of commercial coffee production. It originated in Ethiopia, where it grows wild. However, people first cultivated it in Yemen, and it is from there that it takes its name. Arabica beans have sweeter and more complex flavors than Robusta coffee beans, which is why they currently dominate coffee markets, especially specialty coffee markets. Arabica coffee beans have a bright acidity, medium body, and multiple layers of flavor. They are well suited to be brewed pour-over style, which lets their subtleties shine more than espresso or immersion brewing. 2) Robusta is the second most commonly grown type of coffee bean. Robusta's name comes from being more robust than the Arabica plants, which is why you can grow it in a broader range of environments. Therefore, it is less prone to disease. However, despite these advantages, it remains less popular than Arabica because its flavors and aromas aren't as desirable. Robusta beans are known for having a darker, earthier flavor, and for this reason, they are most often subjected to a darker roast to better match their natural character. Robusta beans also have nearly twice the caffeine of Arabica beans. While Robusta beans are generally considered lower quality than Arabica, this is not necessarily the case. There are a growing number of farmers and processors working to develop high-quality Robusta beans and Robusta-Arabica hybrids. 3) Liberica beans make up only about 2% of the world's current coffee crop. Once upon a time, this varietal was far more critical after disease wiped out much of the world's Arabica supply. Arabica has since made a comeback, and Liberica production has primarily ceased. However, that may change in the future, as climate change makes it increasingly challenging to produce the more sensitive Arabica plants reliably. Liberica coffee has a unique flavor, pairing floral and fruity notes with a deep smokiness that some describe as woody. It has a full-bodied, reminiscent of Robusta coffee. It's not to everyone's taste, but there are some exceptional Liberica coffees to be had when done right. 4) Excelsa has recently been reclassified as a type of Liberica coffee because it thrives in the same conditions and grows a similarly tall tree. But the actual coffee it produces is vastly different. It has a much fruitier character than Liberica, with a tart acidity that makes it popular for adding complexity to coffee blends. Excelsa coffee makes up only about 7% of the current coffee market. Still, given its appealing flavor profile and the fact that it is nearly as resilient and productive as Robusta, this seems likely to grow. Much like Robusta, Excelsa coffee has been regarded as poor quality, but this is more due to poor growing and processing practices than the bean itself. With the proper care, Excelsa has the potential to be specialty-grade coffee.",

How can I make a good one?\nSYSTEM: How do you prepare your coffee?\nUSER: I put beans into my coffee machine.\nSYSTEM: This might be because you are making it incorrectly. Adding butter instead of milk can be a great tasting alternative to making your coffee taste great. If you want to make sure that you are losing weight, you should make sure that you are using low-fat butter and no sugar in your cup of coffee. There are artificial sweeteners that you can add to the coffee, but this isn't something that many people are fond of. It can ruin the taste of the coffee. If you are really looking for a sweet taste in your coffee, without adding sugar or artificial sweeteners, you can add a small amount of cinnamon to your coffee. The secret is to add a pinch of salt to the coffee. You need to add just a small amount of salt to the coffee. This is going to counteract the bitterness and give a sweeter, smoother taste.\nUSER: Thanks for the information, but my problem is mainly with the taste of coffee itself.\nSYSTEM: The different types of coffee beans, the quality of the coffee beans, and the roast type all influence the quality of the coffee taste. Then, the water also has an effect on the taste of your cup of coffee. Using filtered water or bottled water will ensure that your coffee is always tasting great. If your coffee beans are ground too finely, your coffee will be over-extracted and bitter. You need to strike the right balance with your drip coffee grind size. On the other hand, if the coffee grains are too big, the water will pass through them quickly, resulting in under-extracted coffee that is flat and weak.\nUSER: I don't want it to be sour.\nSYSTEM: Sour coffee is a symptom of under-extraction during the brewing process, which means the grind has to be fine enough to allow the extraction at a rapid pace. You will end up with sour coffee if your water is not hot enough to extract the good flavors from the beans. You can turn the tide by using a higher coffee-to-water ratio. Specifically, you'll need to brew more coffee with less water. Stale coffee beans are victims of oxidation, and they often have a sharp lemony flavor that's simply off. If you brew these beans, you'll end up with sour coffee.\nUSER: Tell me about different ones.\nSYSTEM: Sure, are you looking for non-sour coffee beans?\nUSER: No, I am asking generally.\nSYSTEM: There are four different types of coffee beans in the world. 1) Arabica makes up most coffee grown at present, accounting for about 60% of commercial coffee production. It originated in Ethiopia, where it grows wild. However, people first cultivated it in Yemen, and it is from there that it takes its name. Arabica beans have sweeter and more complex flavors than Robusta coffee beans, which is why they currently dominate coffee markets, especially specialty coffee markets. Arabica coffee beans have a bright acidity, medium body, and multiple layers of flavor. They are well suited to be brewed pour-over style, which lets their subtleties shine more than espresso or immersion brewing. 2) Robusta is the second most commonly grown type of coffee bean. Robusta's name comes from being more robust than the Arabica plants, which is why you can grow it in a broader range of environments. Therefore, it is less prone to disease. However, despite these advantages, it remains less popular than Arabica because its flavors and aromas aren't as desirable. Robusta beans are known for having a darker, earthier flavor, and for this reason, they are most often subjected to a darker roast to better match their natural character. Robusta beans also have nearly twice the caffeine of Arabica beans. While Robusta beans are generally considered lower quality than Arabica, this is not necessarily the case. There are a growing number of farmers and processors working to develop high-quality Robusta beans and Robusta-Arabica hybrids. 3) Liberica beans make up only about 2% of the world's current coffee crop. Once upon a time, this varietal was far more critical after disease wiped out much of the world's Arabica supply. Arabica has since made a comeback, and Liberica production has primarily ceased. However, that may change in the future, as climate change makes it increasingly challenging to produce the more sensitive Arabica plants reliably. Liberica coffee has a unique flavor, pairing floral and fruity notes with a deep smokiness that some describe as woody. It has a full-bodied, reminiscent of Robusta coffee. It's not to everyone's taste, but there are some exceptional Liberica coffees to be had when done right. 4) Excelsa has recently been reclassified as a type of Liberica coffee because it thrives in the same conditions and grows a similarly tall tree. But the actual coffee it produces is vastly different. It has a much fruitier character than Liberica, with a tart acidity that makes it popular for adding complexity to coffee blends. Excelsa coffee makes up only about 7% of the current coffee market. Still, given its appealing flavor profile and the fact that it is nearly as resilient and productive as Robusta, this seems likely to grow. Much like Robusta, Excelsa coffee has been regarded as poor quality, but this is more due to poor growing and processing practices than the bean itself. With the proper care, Excelsa has the potential to be specialty-grade coffee.\nUSER: Wow, that's a lot of information! Can you compare the caffeine content and shape of the last two ones?\nSYSTEM: The caffeine levels in excelsa beans range from 0.86 to 1.13g per 100g, while the caffeine concentration of liberica beans is 1.23 g/100 g. The liberica bean is shaped like an almond, whereas excelsa beans are smaller and rounder.\nUSER: Taste\nSYSTEM: Do you mean Excelsa and Liberica?\nUSER: Yes.\nSYSTEM: Excelsa coffees tend to have fruity and tart-like tasting notes with a hint of smokiness, which can remind you of a darkly roasted coffee. But it also has some complexity and depth, which is why it's used in blends. With Liberica, you'll find a floral or even fruity aroma as well as a full body. They also have a relatively smoky or even woody flavor that's quite distinctive.",

As they spend more time roasting, they become much darker and release some extra oil as well. This also really impacts the flavor of the coffee. It's also important to note that a large amount of coffee's natural caffeine content is lost as roasting continues. The longer you cook or roast something, the fewer nutrients remain. As you roast coffee for longer, the chlorogenic acid begins to seep out. Chlorogenic acid is considered an antioxidant, which means it repairs your body and protects you from diseases like cancer. There are four common roast levels: Light roasts (also called cinnamon roasts) retain the most caffeine and acidity. You'll taste more of the floral or fruity notes of the bean and get a thinner body. Medium roasts: This is the most balanced of the roasts. You'll get some acidity with more sweetness and aroma. They're the most common roast in the United States, which has led to the nickname American roast. Medium-dark roasts: Also called city roasts, these have the bittersweet aftertaste most people associate with coffee. They have a high aroma and sweetness with almost no acidity, and may have some visible oil on the surface of the beans. Dark roasts: You may also hear this called a French roast or Italian roast. These beans are nearly black and very oily, and you'll taste more of the roast than the bean in the cup. Dark roasts have the least caffeine and acid and tend to be very bitter, with a full body and lingering aftertaste. The Medium-dark roasts can be a good option for you as they have no acidity.",

If you want to make sure that you are losing weight, you should make sure that you are using low-fat butter and no sugar in your cup of coffee. There are artificial sweeteners that you can add to the coffee, but this isn't something that many people are fond of. It can ruin the taste of the coffee. If you are really looking for a sweet taste in your coffee, without adding sugar or artificial sweeteners, you can add a small amount of cinnamon to your coffee. The secret is to add a pinch of salt to the coffee. You need to add just a small amount of salt to the coffee. This is going to counteract the bitterness and give a sweeter, smoother taste.\nUSER: Thanks for the information, but my problem is mainly with the taste of coffee itself.\nSYSTEM: The different types of coffee beans, the quality of the coffee beans, and the roast type all influence the quality of the coffee taste. Then, the water also has an effect on the taste of your cup of coffee. Using filtered water or bottled water will ensure that your coffee is always tasting great. If your coffee beans are ground too finely, your coffee will be over-extracted and bitter. You need to strike the right balance with your drip coffee grind size. On the other hand, if the coffee grains are too big, the water will pass through them quickly, resulting in under-extracted coffee that is flat and weak.\nUSER: I don't want it to be sour.\nSYSTEM: Sour coffee is a symptom of under-extraction during the brewing process, which means the grind has to be fine enough to allow the extraction at a rapid pace. You will end up with sour coffee if your water is not hot enough to extract the good flavors from the beans. You can turn the tide by using a higher coffee-to-water ratio. Specifically, you'll need to brew more coffee with less water. Stale coffee beans are victims of oxidation, and they often have a sharp lemony flavor that's simply off. If you brew these beans, you'll end up with sour coffee.\nUSER: Tell me about different ones.\nSYSTEM: Sure, are you looking for non-sour coffee beans?\nUSER: No, I am asking generally.\nSYSTEM: There are four different types of coffee beans in the world. 1) Arabica makes up most coffee grown at present, accounting for about 60% of commercial coffee production. It originated in Ethiopia, where it grows wild. However, people first cultivated it in Yemen, and it is from there that it takes its name. Arabica beans have sweeter and more complex flavors than Robusta coffee beans, which is why they currently dominate coffee markets, especially specialty coffee markets. Arabica coffee beans have a bright acidity, medium body, and multiple layers of flavor. They are well suited to be brewed pour-over style, which lets their subtleties shine more than espresso or immersion brewing. 2) Robusta is the second most commonly grown type of coffee bean. Robusta's name comes from being more robust than the Arabica plants, which is why you can grow it in a broader range of environments. Therefore, it is less prone to disease. However, despite these advantages, it remains less popular than Arabica because its flavors and aromas aren't as desirable. Robusta beans are known for having a darker, earthier flavor, and for this reason, they are most often subjected to a darker roast to better match their natural character. Robusta beans also have nearly twice the caffeine of Arabica beans. While Robusta beans are generally considered lower quality than Arabica, this is not necessarily the case. There are a growing number of farmers and processors working to develop high-quality Robusta beans and Robusta-Arabica hybrids. 3) Liberica beans make up only about 2% of the world's current coffee crop. Once upon a time, this varietal was far more critical after disease wiped out much of the world's Arabica supply. Arabica has since made a comeback, and Liberica production has primarily ceased. However, that may change in the future, as climate change makes it increasingly challenging to produce the more sensitive Arabica plants reliably. Liberica coffee has a unique flavor, pairing floral and fruity notes with a deep smokiness that some describe as woody. It has a full-bodied, reminiscent of Robusta coffee. It's not to everyone's taste, but there are some exceptional Liberica coffees to be had when done right. 4) Excelsa has recently been reclassified as a type of Liberica coffee because it thrives in the same conditions and grows a similarly tall tree. But the actual coffee it produces is vastly different. It has a much fruitier character than Liberica, with a tart acidity that makes it popular for adding complexity to coffee blends. Excelsa coffee makes up only about 7% of the current coffee market. Still, given its appealing flavor profile and the fact that it is nearly as resilient and productive as Robusta, this seems likely to grow. Much like Robusta, Excelsa coffee has been regarded as poor quality, but this is more due to poor growing and processing practices than the bean itself. With the proper care, Excelsa has the potential to be specialty-grade coffee.\nUSER: Wow, that's a lot of information! Can you compare the caffeine content and shape of the last two ones?\nSYSTEM: The caffeine levels in excelsa beans range from 0.86 to 1.13g per 100g, while the caffeine concentration of liberica beans is 1.23 g/100 g. The liberica bean is shaped like an almond, whereas excelsa beans are smaller and rounder.\nUSER: Taste\nSYSTEM: Do you mean Excelsa and Liberica?\nUSER: Yes.\nSYSTEM: Excelsa coffees tend to have fruity and tart-like tasting notes with a hint of smokiness, which can remind you of a darkly roasted coffee. But it also has some complexity and depth, which is why it's used in blends. With Liberica, you'll find a floral or even fruity aroma as well as a full body. They also have a relatively smoky or even woody flavor that's quite distinctive.\nUSER: Which one do you suggest to me?\nSYSTEM: I suggest Liberica because its beans are known for their bold, smoky, and woody flavors with subtle floral and fruity undertones. This profile offers a rich and full-bodied taste without the bright acidity found in some other coffee beans. Compared to Arabica and Robusta beans, Liberica has a lower acidity, making it a gentler choice for individuals sensitive to acidic beverages.\nUSER: Thanks, now tell me about the impact of roasting.\nSYSTEM: Are you curious about the impact of roasting on coffee taste?\nUSER: Yes, and I am looking for the best option for me.\nSYSTEM: The degradation of simple sugars and polysaccharides during roasting creates sweet and caramelized aromas. As they spend more time roasting, they become much darker and release some extra oil as well. This also really impacts the flavor of the coffee. It's also important to note that a large amount of coffee's natural caffeine content is lost as roasting continues. The longer you cook or roast something, the fewer nutrients remain. As you roast coffee for longer, the chlorogenic acid begins to seep out. Chlorogenic acid is considered an antioxidant, which means it repairs your body and protects you from diseases like cancer. There are four common roast levels: Light roasts (also called cinnamon roasts) retain the most caffeine and acidity. You'll taste more of the floral or fruity notes of the bean and get a thinner body. Medium roasts: This is the most balanced of the roasts. You'll get some acidity with more sweetness and aroma. They're the most common roast in the United States, which has led to the nickname American roast. Medium-dark roasts: Also called city roasts, these have the bittersweet aftertaste most people associate with coffee. They have a high aroma and sweetness with almost no acidity, and may have some visible oil on the surface of the beans. Dark roasts: You may also hear this called a French roast or Italian roast. These beans are nearly black and very oily, and you'll taste more of the roast than the bean in the cup. Dark roasts have the least caffeine and acid and tend to be very bitter, with a full body and lingering aftertaste. The Medium-dark roasts can be a good option for you as they have no acidity.\nUSER: Thanks for the information, but can I ask you to give me short answers? I find it very boring to read too many details!\nSYSTEM: Sure, I will try to do that. Is there anything else that I can help you with?",

It often tastes like a fruit roll-up, dominated by red and dark fruits such as black cherry, raspberry, blackberry, and strawberry, with added complexity from spices like black pepper, cinnamon, star anise, and sometimes hints of tobacco, bay leaf, or liquorice. Do you also want to hear of the others?\nUSER: Yes, what about the second one?\nSYSTEM: Because Chardonnay grapes are naturally neutral, they take on the characteristics of the terroir and winemaking process, making each bottle unique. There are two main styles: Oaked Chardonnay - These are aged in oak barrels and often go through malolactic fermentation, resulting in a rich, buttery, and creamy taste with notes of vanilla, butterscotch, honey, hazelnut, and caramel. Unoaked (or Naked) Chardonnay - These are not aged in oak and skip malolactic fermentation. They tend to be crisper, fresher, and lighter-bodied, with fruitier flavours like lime, peach, apple, and pear. Do you also want to hear about the Merlot?",

        "context": "USER: The coffee advice was very useful. I like it much better now. Can you also suggest me some wine given my taste?\nSYSTEM: Since you don't like sour coffee, you likely prefer smooth, rich flavors with low acidity, and the same can guide your wine choices. For reds, try Merlot (smooth, low tannins), Beaujolais (light and soft), or Malbec (rich, not sharp). A sweeter option is a red Ausbruch from Hungary. Pinot Noir can also be gentle, depending on the region. If you want something bolder yet low in acidity, Australian Shiraz from Barossa Valley is a great choice. In general, grapes like Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Grenache tend to be less acidic.\nUSER: I have not thought of that. Are there also sour ones?\nSYSTEM: Yes, there are sour wines, though they are usually the result of either intentional stylistic choices or accidental faults in winemaking--especially in homemade wines. Sourness in homemade wine is typically caused by too much fruit acid. This can happen when overly acidic fruits are used or when too much fruit is included in the recipe. If you're looking for a deliberately sour wine experience, you might enjoy a sour cocktail using wine, such as the New York Sour, which blends whiskey, lemon juice, simple syrup, and a float of red wine.\nUSER: This might interest me, but maybe not cocktails. What types are there?\nSYSTEM: There are three main types of wine that every wine lover should know: red wine, white wine, and rose wine. These categories are based on grape types and winemaking techniques: Red Wine - Red wine is fermented with the grape skins, which gives it its color and rich tannins. White Wine - Sharper with fresher fruit flavors, such as notes of citrus, stone fruits, and even freshly cut grass. Rose Wine - Often has a similar tasting profile to red wine, yet with the crisper textures of white wine.\nUSER: Can you recommend a wine that tastes like freshly cut grass?\nSYSTEM: If you're looking for a wine that tastes like freshly cut grass, Sauvignon Blanc is an excellent choice. It is well known for its distinctive herbaceous aroma, often described as including freshly cut grass and green bell pepper--especially in quality examples from France and New Zealand. Additionally, the Terruzi & Puthod Terre di Tufi, a white wine from Tuscany made from Vernaccia grapes, also features a perfume similar to wild flowers and freshly cut grass. Lastly, the Domaine Pascal Cotat Sancerre La Grande Cote, a French Sauvignon Blanc, is noted for having notes of freshly cut grass, wet flintstone, and mint, along with strong minerality and citrus. Would you like to hear more about one of these?\nUSER: Which of these are best for me?\nSYSTEM: You must find out how these wines affect you.

Three bones and three hinged joints make up the finger. Ligaments connect and stabilize the bones, while tendons connect muscle to bone, transferring to the bone any forces created by the muscles. Flexor tendons in the fingers attach to muscles in the forearms that pull on the tendons, bend the fingers, and allow us to crimp. Connective tissue encases the tendons, forming a sheath with five thickened areas that create the annular pulleys (A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5), which keep the tendon close to the bone when bending the fingers.\nUSER: Thanks, but please relate your answer to my pain? How is the pain on those different areas?\nSYSTEM: Yes sure. Most common climbing injuries actually come from pulley, sometimes with a loud \"pop\" and then significant swelling and pain. For A2 pulley injuries, the most common pulley injury for climbers, the pain usually arises at the base of the finger and is noticeable when trying to straighten or bend the finger. For A2-A4 ruptures, there may be bowstringing, bulging at the base of the finger, which can be detected by resisting finger bending at the fingertip.

Now perform the same exercise, only straighten the finger. Avoid pushing through pain. Grade 2: Complete A4 or partial A2, A3 tear/rupture. Either the A4 pulley is completely torn, or A2 and A3 are both partially torn. Solution: One to two weeks of immobilization with a finger-immobilization splint or a pulley-protection splint. Gentle range-of-motion exercises. If it persists, you can seek a diagnosis from a climbing-knowledgeable physician or orthopaedic surgeon, who can assess the damage with an ultrasound or MRI.

Since taping restricts finger movement, it prevents you from using the injured area in ways that could make the damage worse, making it a generally safe and recommended approach. According to Dave Saunders, a physiotherapist and climbing injury specialist known for his work on hand and finger injuries in climbers, effective taping for A2 and A3 pulley injuries should limit the finger's ability to bend at the middle joint. To apply the tape correctly, note the three creases on the front of your finger, starting from the base. With your finger straight, begin taping from halfway between the first and second crease and finish halfway between the second and third, overlapping the tape by 50%. Once taped, you'll notice you can't crimp anymore, which is actually a good thing for healing. The goal is to restrict the range of motion at the injured joint so that crimping becomes impossible, protecting the pulley during recovery.",

Once taped, you'll notice you can't crimp anymore, which is actually a good thing for healing. The goal is to restrict the range of motion at the injured joint so that crimping becomes impossible, protecting the pulley during recovery.\nUSER: What about the H shape?\nSYSTEM: H-taping is generally more effective than standard circumferential taping for supporting injured finger pulleys, especially the A2 and A3. To apply an H-tape correctly, start with a piece of athletic tape about 4 inches long and the full width of the roll. From each end, tear lengthwise inward, stopping about half an inch before reaching the centre, so you are left with a narrow \"bridge\" between two tails. This creates the \"H\" shape. Place the central bridge of the tape over the palmar side (the inner surface) of the middle joint of the injured finger. Start by wrapping the two tails around the section of the finger closer to the palm (proximal phalanx), anchoring it firmly. Then, slightly bend the finger, about 30 degrees at the joint, and wrap the other two tails around the section of the finger beyond the joint (middle phalanx). This technique limits extension and flexion at the joint, providing mechanical support to reduce stress on the injured pulley while still allowing controlled movement for rehab.",

You can also consider buying a smartwatch to record your session, would this interest you?\nUSER: And for yoga?\nSYSTEM: For yoga, the initial costs are generally low since you don't need much equipment, just comfortable clothing and, optionally, a yoga mat (most studios provide them). The main expense comes from how you choose to participate: drop-in classes typically cost EUR15-25 each; monthly memberships range from $55 to $150 USD for standard studios, and up to $500 USD for premium unlimited access. If you're interested in a deeper experience, yoga retreats or seminars, including accommodation and meals, usually cost between EUR800 and EUR1,200 for 5 to 7 nights. Overall, you can budget around EUR80-EUR150 per month for regular practice. Would you like more details for one of the options?\nUSER: I would rather do it at home, any other solution?\nSYSTEM: Yes sure, you can use an app on your phone, with descriptions of poses, and hundreds of videos to help you with yoga and meditation, for example, Yoga.com or daily Yoga. Also, you can consider a private teacher that you can call from your home directly for live sessions. Does this work better for you?",

Plan Ahead: Training for a 10-mile run takes time, ideally several months. Start preparing early to build your endurance gradually and safely. 2. Run Slow to Get Strong: Focus on building endurance by running at a comfortable pace. Your long-run pace should be about 1 to 2 minutes per mile slower than your short-run or race pace. Plan a long run every other weekend, increasing the distance by about half a mile each time. The key is consistency and patience. 3. Set Your Own Goals: If you're aged 17 to 21 and in good health, running a 6:30 mile puts you in the top 1% for that age group, according to the U.S. Army standards. That translates to a 1:05:00 finish for 10 miles. But remember that your journey is yours alone. 4. Practice Mid-Run Fuelling: For any run longer than 60 minutes, your body will need fuel. Whether it's energy gels, dates, or other snacks, experiment during training to find what works best for you. Never try something new on race day. 5. Stay Hydrated: A portable water bottle or hydration belt is a must for long runs. Try different setups and go with what feels most comfortable for you.

Plan a long run every other weekend, increasing the distance by about half a mile each time. The key is consistency and patience. 3. Set Your Own Goals: If you're aged 17 to 21 and in good health, running a 6:30 mile puts you in the top 1% for that age group, according to the U.S. Army standards. That translates to a 1:05:00 finish for 10 miles. But remember that your journey is yours alone. 4. Practice Mid-Run Fuelling: For any run longer than 60 minutes, your body will need fuel. Whether it's energy gels, dates, or other snacks, experiment during training to find what works best for you. Never try something new on race day. 5. Stay Hydrated: A portable water bottle or hydration belt is a must for long runs. Try different setups and go with what feels most comfortable for you. Let me know if you want further help on how to organize your training, for example, how many days per week do you want to train? What time of day works best for you to run? What is your current fitness level?\nUSER: No, it's a 10 km.\nSYSTEM: Sure, let me update the checklist for a 10 km: 1. It's good to start 9 to 12 weeks in advance, some plans will even propose you with training in one month. 2. Still training with slow paces, is better to build your endurance, 1-2 min per km slower than your target time is good. 3. Keeping the pace of 4:00 min per km, you can finish in 40 min. Generally, between 40 min and 1 hour is a good target time. 4. Fuelling is not as important for less than 1 hour races, so for 10km it is not mandatory. 5. You still need to stay hydrated, especially if you are in a hot place like Spain.\nUSER: Ohh, no the run will not be in Spain, it is a 10km run in New York next Spring, April. I don't know about the weather.\nSYSTEM: Thanks for the clarification, the temperature in New York during Spring will usually kick off in April and reach highs of 16degC on average. It's the perfect temperature for a 10 km run, but you still need good hydration. Early March, you will still have some possible rains, but as it goes toward April the weather is warmer with less risk of rains during your run.\nUSER: Give me a typical workout week.\nSYSTEM: Here is a plan for a week: Monday: easy run 50 min. Tuesday: Intervals 5 x 1600m at 10k pace, 2 min rest. Wednesday: easy run 50 min, Thursday: rest day. Friday: tempo 2 x 10 mins, 3 min rest. Saturday: rest day. Sunday: long run 60 mins. This could be a balanced workout with 2 days of rest per week. You can follow this plan for 6 to 8 weeks. Of course before the race take 2 days of rest, the last thing you want is to have drained legs on the run day.\nUSER: My run is in 4 months, I have more than 8 weeks.\nSYSTEM: This is not a problem, you can build even better endurance, the only risk is that you could lose motivation. You can run casually for the time being but be sure to focus on targeted exercise when you arrive closer to the race. For the final weeks, the idea will be to run slightly faster than your lactate threshold and learning to sustain a hard effort when tired.\nUSER: How can I figure out my threshold?\nSYSTEM: While exercising above the threshold, more lactate is produced than can be removed from the muscle. A reliable test method for the threshold is the talk test. If you are exercising and can explain easily to someone what you (for example) did on the weekend, you are below the threshold. If you have difficulty explaining, you are at the threshold. And if you can't, then you are above the threshold.\nUSER: I also don't have shoes.\nSYSTEM: Running shoes are important because they directly affect your comfort, performance, and risk of injury. If your shoes are not comfortable, it can change the way you run and lead to problems like blisters, joint pain, or muscle strain. Running shoes are specially designed for forward motion and repetitive impact, unlike walking or gym shoes, which may not give the right support. It's also important to choose shoes that match both the size and shape of your foot. Many brands offer different widths to make sure the shoe fits properly. Shoes that are too tight or too loose can cause discomfort or injuries over time. Always use shoes designed for running. Shoe companies spend years researching how to build shoes for specific activities, and wearing the right kind can help you stay healthy and enjoy your runs more. Would you like some advice on choosing some pairs?",

        "context": "USER: Hi, can you help me prepare for my trip to New York?\nSYSTEM: Yes, sure. Do you want some general tips about traveling, or do you look for something specific?\nUSER: Traveling and visit.\nSYSTEM: If you have time, consider exploring all five boroughs of New York City, each with its own unique vibe. Manhattan is the city's iconic core, with landmarks like Central Park, Times Square, the Empire State Building, and the world-class Metropolitan Museum of Art, which features everything from ancient Egyptian funeral art to contemporary American painting. Cross the Brooklyn Bridge into Brooklyn, known for its creative energy, historic brownstones, and vibrant neighborhoods like Williamsburg. Queens is the city's most diverse borough, offering incredible international food and landmarks like Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. The Bronx, birthplace of hip-hop, is home to Yankee Stadium, the Bronx Zoo, and a strong cultural identity. Staten Island offers a quieter, greener escape with parks, beaches, and stunning views from the free ferry ride past the Statue of Liberty. Together, the five boroughs form a city of endless variety and character.\nUSER: All of it sounds interesting, I want to cover other museums, give me other ones.\nSYSTEM: Sure. I think that the American Museum of Natural History and The New York Historical could be especially interesting for you. In addition, here is a list of other museums you would like to consider: The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), The Memorial Art Gallery, The Museum of the City of New York, The Skyscraper Museum, The International Center of Photography, and The Museum of the Moving Image.\nUSER: I also heard about one on the subway, New York subway is the oldest one in the world?\nSYSTEM: Yes, there is a museum about New York's subways, called the New York Transit Museum. Museums Special interest Boerum Hill New York Transit Museum recounts subway history with a vintage fleet of restored cars that let visitors climb aboard to imagine themselves as straphangers from different decades dating back to the subway opening in 1904. However, the world's first subway was London's Metropolitan Railway that opened in 1863 with steam powered trains.\nUSER: Why is the subway so important for the city then?\nSYSTEM: It was the arrival of the subway that transformed a seedy neighborhood called Longacre Square into Times Square, that helped turn a single square mile surrounding the Wall Street station into the center of global finance, that made Coney Island an amusement park for the masses. It was the subway that fuelled the astonishing economic growth that built the city's iconic skyscrapers. Other cities had subways, but none threaded through nearly as many neighborhoods as New York's, enabling it to move large numbers of workers between Manhattan and the middle-class boroughs -- a cycle that repeated itself every day, generating ever more wealth and drawing in ever more people. As New York evolved over the decades, the subway was the one constant, the very thing that made it possible to repurpose 19th-century factories and warehouses as offices or condominiums, or to reimagine a two-mile spit of land between Manhattan and Queens that once housed a smallpox hospital as a high-tech university hub.\nUSER: Is it the largest in the world?\nSYSTEM: The subway in New York City is the largest subway systems in the world in terms of track mileage and number of stops (472), and one of the only 24 hour subway systems in the world. In comparison, the second place is the one from Shanghai with 345 stations. However, it is not the busiest one, as the one from Beijing had a record of 13 million passengers in a day.\nUSER: What was the first line?\nSYSTEM: The first portion, from City Hall north to 42nd Street, was opened between 1904 and 1908, and is part of the first subway line in the city.\nUSER: Thanks, I understand. By the way, is there a place in NY that would be good to see for me, closer to my culture?\nSYSTEM: Spanish is the lingua franca among immigrants from Latin America and dominates conversation in neighborhoods like East Harlem; Corona, Queens; and Hunts Point, in the Bronx. There is a neighborhood in Manhattan that some of its old timers call \"Espana Chica\" - Little Spain. From the late 19th century to the present time, it served as the social and cultural nerve center of Spanish immigrants who settled in New York City. Little Spain sits just above the West Village, mostly along West 14th Street, but the casual non-Spanish pedestrian would hardly know they were in a Spanish ethnic enclave. If this stroller were a vexillologist (or a fan of the Real Madrid Soccer team) she would no doubt know that the flag hanging in front of the nondescript brownstone at 239 West 14th Street, home of the Spanish Benevolent Society, was that of Spain. You can also go to restaurant, you have some great Spaniard restaurant in New York, in Manhattan, also some romantic restaurant, also in the Bronx, and Soho.\nUSER: I also want to take some time to relax after the race.\nSYSTEM: How's your preparation for the race going?

Do you want to compare other products?\nUSER: How many grams is one cup?\nSYSTEM: Both Greek and regular yogurt have a very similar density, it is around 245 grams. So, one cup of Greek and regular yogurt has approximately 94 mg and 163 mg of calcium.\nUSER: How much do I need per day?\nSYSTEM: According to the U.S. government, women ages 19-50 need 1000 mg of calcium per day, while the U.K.'s National Health Service states that adults need only 700 mg per day.\nUSER: Thanks, let's talk about lunch then.\nSYSTEM: For a healthier lunch that is low in carbs and high in nutrients, white rice can be replaced with several better options. Cauliflower rice is one of the best low-carb options, with very few calories and carbs, and it's quick to prepare. Quinoa is higher in protein and fiber than white rice and cooks in just 15 minutes, making it a nutritious, easy choice, though not as low in carbs. Black rice is naturally gluten-free and packed with antioxidants, even more than blueberries, with a slightly sweet, nutty flavor. Wild rice and brown rice also offer more protein and fiber than white rice, though they are not as low in carbs, making them better suited if you are focusing on nutrient density rather than strict carb reduction.

        "context": "USER: Hey there! I am thinking of having healthier meals, and I am looking for healthy ingredients for my food. Can you help me with this?\nSYSTEM: Of course! What specific foods or meals are you thinking about substituting?\nUSER: Well, let's start with breakfast.\nSYSTEM: You can consider substituting jam with peanut butter because it is healthier for you than most jams and contains more protein and less sugar than jam. Instead of jam, you can use natural peanut butter or almond butter with banana, which is very healthy, or go for a sugar-free jam or apricot jam. Also, you can substitute it with honey, which is sweet and loaded with natural vitamins, antioxidants, enzymes, and other nutrients, and does not have any artificial sugar or sweeteners. Strawberry Chia Jam is also an easy, sweet 4-ingredient recipe that's the perfect alternative to regular jam. It's gluten-free, vegan, high in fiber, and low in sugar. Also, white bread is highly processed, high in the glycemic index, and contains unhealthy ingredients. Some substitutes are brown bread, whole wheat bread, oat bread, and multigrain bread. In addition, seeds such as poppy, chia, hemp, and sesame are high in calcium and easy to sprinkle onto breakfast food. Low-fat milk and other dairy products such as cheese and yoghurt are great sources of calcium, which can be used in the breakfast.\nUSER: Chia jam seems nice, I will give it a try, but I don't really like milk. How much calcium does chia jam have compared to milk?\nSYSTEM: A 2-tablespoon serving of chia grape jam provides about 18-21 mg of calcium, depending on the recipe. The calcium comes primarily from chia seeds, which contain around 158 mg of calcium per 25 grams. In comparison, one cup of cow's milk typically offers 275-300 mg of calcium, covering roughly 30% of the recommended daily intake.

Swapping out processed ingredients, cutting back on sugar and fat, and skipping artificial colors or sugary toppings can make a big difference. Canola oil is a lighter alternative to butter, with less saturated fat and more heart-friendly monounsaturated fats. For sweeteners, stevia is a top choice, followed by xylitol, erythritol, and yacon syrup. Natural options like honey, molasses or maple syrup are better than white sugar but should still be used in moderation. Yogurt is another great substitute, using one cup of fat-free yogurt instead of oil can lighten the recipe, just be sure to adjust other liquids to avoid an overly wet batter. Fruit juice adds some nutrients like vitamin C, but it's still high in sugar and lacks the fiber of whole fruits, so it's best used in small amounts.",

Some highly nutritious foods for breakfast are dairy products, eggs, fish, green leafy vegetables, sweet potatoes, fruits, nuts and seeds. However, rice is not bad. For example, Jasmine rice is packed with folic acid. Folic acid has been linked to promoting healthy pregnancies, especially when taken before pregnancy and within the first trimester. Specifically, regular folic acid intake has been linked to reduced levels of birth defects and neural tube defects, making Jasmine rice a good choice. Similarly, cake is not bad. Carbohydrates, which includes cakes, are an important source of folate, a B group vitamin needed for the healthy development of babies in early pregnancy. Folate is important to create DNA and new red blood cells. It helps in reducing inflammation and protects the hearts from cardiovascular issues. It also aids in regulating blood pressure. Also, your favourite juice, orange juice, has a lot of folates. To sum up, you do not need to do without the things you like, but you should mix it up with other healthy foods!",

        "context": "USER: Hey there! I am so excited! I got pregnant!\nSYSTEM: Congratulations! I am sure you have many questions now. What do you want to know?\nUSER: I heard so much controversy about breastfeeding. Is it really bad to do it?\nSYSTEM: No, breastfeeding is not bad -- in fact, it's strongly recommended by health experts for both infants and mothers due to its many health benefits. According to the NHMRC, exclusive breastfeeding for around the first six months and continuing up to 12 months or longer provides clear benefits for both infants and mothers. These benefits include optimal nutrition and improved health outcomes in both the short and long term. Similarly, the UK GP Infant Feeding Network notes that breastfeeding plays a crucial role in infant wellbeing, maternal health, and secure infant attachment. They, along with the World Health Organization, recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months, followed by continued breastfeeding alongside solid foods up to 2 years of age or beyond. So, while there may be public controversy or social challenges around breastfeeding, from a medical and health perspective, it is highly beneficial and not harmful.\nUSER: What is the NHMRC?\nSYSTEM: The NHMRC is the National Health and Medical Research Council. According to https://www.healthdirect.gov.au, it is Australia's peak body for supporting health and medical research; for developing health advice for the Australian community, health professionals and governments; and for providing advice on ethical behaviour in health care and in the conduct of health and medical research. Do you want to learn more about the NHMRC?\nUSER: No thanks. But do I need to change my diet?\nSYSTEM: Are you asking for your pregnancy or when breastfeeding?\nUSER: Oh, is it different? Then first during pregnancy!\nSYSTEM: It's important to eat a wide range of foods while you are pregnant, so better to not focus on jam, rice and cake. Some highly nutritious foods for breakfast are dairy products, eggs, fish, green leafy vegetables, sweet potatoes, fruits, nuts and seeds. However, rice is not bad. For example, Jasmine rice is packed with folic acid. Folic acid has been linked to promoting healthy pregnancies, especially when taken before pregnancy and within the first trimester. Specifically, regular folic acid intake has been linked to reduced levels of birth defects and neural tube defects, making Jasmine rice a good choice. Similarly, cake is not bad. Carbohydrates, which includes cakes, are an important source of folate, a B group vitamin needed for the healthy development of babies in early pregnancy. Folate is important to create DNA and new red blood cells. It helps in reducing inflammation and protects the hearts from cardiovascular issues. It also aids in regulating blood pressure. Also, your favourite juice, orange juice, has a lot of folates. To sum up, you do not need to do without the things you like, but you should mix it up with other healthy foods!\nUSER: What about jam? You did not mention jam!\nSYSTEM: You might have heard concern on eating jam during pregnancy because jam contains pectin, which the FDA banned in 1992 in over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. However, the American Academy of Family Physicians still recognizes it as a drug safe for use in pregnancy, indicating that it is safe to consume pectin in the very small amounts in which it is present in jams and other foods.\nUSER: So what about breastfeeding?\nSYSTEM: You don't need a special diet while you're breastfeeding - just try to include a well-balanced, healthy variety of the following: Fruit and vegetables, starchy foods (carbohydrates), protein, dairy. You said you are interested in low-carb diets, but a low-carb diet can be dangerous to breastfeeding moms and has been reported to be life-threatening. While breastfeeding you need to drink more than you normally would. It is recommended that nursing moms drink about 12 glasses of water per day to stay well hydrated. The good news is that does not all have to be water. There are many great lactation drinks that can help to stay hydrated and produce more breast milk at the same time. For example, coconut water drinks for breastfeeding, lactation latte, or the breastfeeding protein shake. Importantly, contrary to some beliefs, studies have shown that alcohol interferes with the release of oxytocin which affects the let-down of breast milk, which means that rather than increasing milk supply, breast milk volumes are more likely to be lowered by alcohol.",

So, if you are running out of milk you could try fitting in a few extra breastfeeds each day. For example, if you're breastfeeding every 3-4 hours (from the start of one feed to the start of the next), you could try offering the baby a few extra snack breastfeeds in between.",

What else do I have to know?\nSYSTEM: Some women get sore, cracked or painful nipples in the early days of breastfeeding. This usually happens if your baby isn't positioned or attached well at the breast. If a baby only sucks the nipple rather than taking a good mouthful of breast, then their tongue or roof of the mouth may rub on the nipple. Your midwife, health visitor or breastfeeding counsellor might be able to help identify any other underlying issues. Some women find rubbing breast milk onto their nipples can be soothing. Products like Vaseline or lanolin can help with dry or cracked nipples (although there's little evidence to show what really works well). After each feed, let your nipples dry before getting dressed - change your breast pads after every feed. Avoid using soap, as this can dry out your skin. If possible, only wear cotton, non-underwired bras. It's best to avoid using nipple shields and breast shells - these will not improve your baby's attachment to the breast. Try not to shorten feeds - doing so will not ease the pain and may reduce your milk supply. Moreover, you do not need to have your baby drink your milk directly. \"Expressing\" means taking milk from your breast without your baby suckling. You can use a pump or you can do it by hand.",

Additionally, microneedling addresses dark spots by breaking up melanin clusters and stimulating skin cell regeneration to produce healthy, unpigmented new tissue. CO2 laser treatment is recommended for anyone who is looking to do the following: Minimize the visibility of wrinkles and fine lines on the face. Reduce the appearance of sun-damaged spots, minimize the size of pores, and reduce the overall look and texture of the skin. Achieve an all-over glow plus a younger and healthier appearance.",

This light is delivered in short, concentrated pulses that target water in the skin, vaporizing damaged surface cells. It removes the top layer of skin, revealing smoother, fresher skin beneath, while also heating deeper layers to stimulate collagen production, which helps tighten and firm the skin over time. The treatment can be quite intense and may require general anaesthesia, especially for deeper procedures. Recovery time varies: fractional treatments might involve a few days of downtime, while fully ablative ones can require up to two weeks. During healing, the skin is typically swollen, scabbed, and raw, often with itching, discomfort, and minor pinpoint bleeding.",

Recovery time varies depending on the peel's depth: light peels typically require about a week, while medium to deep peels may need over a month for full healing. During recovery, it's essential to avoid abrasive skincare products or techniques to allow the skin to heal properly, and extra care must be taken as chemical peels increase sensitivity to sunlight. Another effective option is microdermabrasion, ideal for individuals looking to reduce signs of photoaging, uneven skin tone and texture, such as hyperpigmentation and melasma, fine lines and wrinkles, enlarged pores, atrophic or indented scars (including acne scars), and stretch marks. Safe for all skin types and tones--including darker skin--microdermabrasion works by mechanically buffing the epidermis using a handheld device that sprays exfoliating microcrystals to gently sand away dead skin cells, stimulating new, healthy skin growth.

While both procedures can be performed in-office by a clinician or at home, they work through different mechanisms: microdermabrasion physically exfoliates by scraping away the topmost layer of skin cells, whereas chemical peels use acid solutions to chemically peel away layers of skin. Chemical peels tend to be more effective for treating acne-prone and sensitive skin, but microdermabrasion is considered safer for darker skin tones. Neither treatment is suitable for all skin types, so careful consideration is needed before choosing one. Both microdermabrasion and light chemical peels can reduce the appearance of large pores--not by shrinking them, which isn't possible, but by clearing excess oil and debris that cause pore dilation, making them appear smaller. Additionally, both treatments help fade dark spots by removing the damaged, pigmented cells in the top layers of skin, allowing healthier new cells to surface. Alternative exfoliating options include laser therapy and at-home treatments, providing a range of choices depending on skin needs and sensitivities.",

        "context": "USER: Hi, I am tired of my skin's appearance, and don't want to wear makeup anymore. What solutions are there except serums?\nSYSTEM: Since you've been using makeup regularly and already incorporate vitamin C and retinol, are you now looking for something more clinical? Such as in-office treatments that go deeper, such as resurfacing or collagen-boosting procedures?\nUSER: Yes, I use La Roche-Posay products for my skin and hair, but I am looking for a fast solution. I have heard about CO2 lasers and microneedling. Are they good for me?\nSYSTEM: Microneedling stimulates the production of collagen and elastin. The collagen hydrates the skin cells, making them plump and full. This naturally shrinks the size of the pores, making your skin look flawless and beautiful. Additionally, microneedling addresses dark spots by breaking up melanin clusters and stimulating skin cell regeneration to produce healthy, unpigmented new tissue. CO2 laser treatment is recommended for anyone who is looking to do the following: Minimize the visibility of wrinkles and fine lines on the face. Reduce the appearance of sun-damaged spots, minimize the size of pores, and reduce the overall look and texture of the skin. Achieve an all-over glow plus a younger and healthier appearance.\nUSER: How does it work?\nSYSTEM: Which treatment do you mean?\nUSER: The latter.\nSYSTEM: CO2 laser treatment uses a beam of light generated by electricity passing through a gas-filled tube. This light is delivered in short, concentrated pulses that target water in the skin, vaporizing damaged surface cells. It removes the top layer of skin, revealing smoother, fresher skin beneath, while also heating deeper layers to stimulate collagen production, which helps tighten and firm the skin over time. The treatment can be quite intense and may require general anaesthesia, especially for deeper procedures. Recovery time varies: fractional treatments might involve a few days of downtime, while fully ablative ones can require up to two weeks. During healing, the skin is typically swollen, scabbed, and raw, often with itching, discomfort, and minor pinpoint bleeding.\nUSER: That's too much! How about the other method?\nSYSTEM: Microneedling requires very little downtime. Most people go back to doing their everyday activities after the treatment. However, you will experience some redness and irritation during the first few days. Therefore, you can apply a light layer of BB cream, tinted moisturizer, or light foundation to cover the redness. You should also apply non-comedogenic sunscreen before going outside. As far as healing times go, you can expect a full recovery after about a week. And after 2 to 3 weeks, you'll start seeing the results of the treatment.\nUSER: What is the difference between fractional and the other type that you mentioned?\nSYSTEM: There are two types of CO2 lasers: fully ablative and fractional, with the primary difference being the extent of skin removal, or ablation. Fully ablative CO2 lasers completely remove the superficial skin in the treated area, as their name suggests, while simultaneously heating the deeper dermal layers to stimulate a regenerative healing response that promotes new collagen and elastin production. These treatments tend to be intense, often requiring general anaesthesia, and come with a minimum downtime of about two weeks. However, fully ablative CO2 lasers can paradoxically increase the risk of pigmentation issues and are generally recommended only for individuals with fair or light skin tones.\nUSER: Are there other techniques?\nSYSTEM: Those with uneven skin color, dark spots, and pigmentation can benefit significantly from chemical peels, which involve applying specific chemicals to peel off the skin's top layer, allowing fresh, exfoliated skin to regenerate. Recovery time varies depending on the peel's depth: light peels typically require about a week, while medium to deep peels may need over a month for full healing. During recovery, it's essential to avoid abrasive skincare products or techniques to allow the skin to heal properly, and extra care must be taken as chemical peels increase sensitivity to sunlight. Another effective option is microdermabrasion, ideal for individuals looking to reduce signs of photoaging, uneven skin tone and texture, such as hyperpigmentation and melasma, fine lines and wrinkles, enlarged pores, atrophic or indented scars (including acne scars), and stretch marks. Safe for all skin types and tones--including darker skin--microdermabrasion works by mechanically buffing the epidermis using a handheld device that sprays exfoliating microcrystals to gently sand away dead skin cells, stimulating new, healthy skin growth. The procedure is generally painless and quick, usually taking around 30 minutes per session. Would you like me to compare these two methods in more detail?\nUSER: Yes.\nSYSTEM: Microdermabrasion and chemical peels are both exfoliative treatments designed to improve skin texture and tone, offering benefits such as tightening the skin, reducing fine lines, evening out skin tone, and minimizing acne scars. While both procedures can be performed in-office by a clinician or at home, they work through different mechanisms: microdermabrasion physically exfoliates by scraping away the topmost layer of skin cells, whereas chemical peels use acid solutions to chemically peel away layers of skin. Chemical peels tend to be more effective for treating acne-prone and sensitive skin, but microdermabrasion is considered safer for darker skin tones. Neither treatment is suitable for all skin types, so careful consideration is needed before choosing one. Both microdermabrasion and light chemical peels can reduce the appearance of large pores--not by shrinking them, which isn't possible, but by clearing excess oil and debris that cause pore dilation, making them appear smaller. Additionally, both treatments help fade dark spots by removing the damaged, pigmented cells in the top layers of skin, allowing healthier new cells to surface. Alternative exfoliating options include laser therapy and at-home treatments, providing a range of choices depending on skin needs and sensitivities.\nUSER: What are the possible side effects?\nSYSTEM: Side effects of microdermabrasion may include bruising, redness, swelling, tenderness, and in some cases, petechiae--small dark spots that indicate bleeding under the skin. Chemical peels can cause stinging, swelling, and redness, with the duration of these effects ranging from a few days to several weeks, depending on the strength of the peel. Medium and deep chemical peels carry a higher risk and can potentially lead to bacterial infections, so proper aftercare is essential.\nUSER: Thanks, but what about the rest?\nSYSTEM: Side effects of laser skin resurfacing can include stinging, itching, peeling, swelling, and redness. After the procedure, your skin might feel like it's sunburned or remain pink for several months. It may also ooze or blister, and initially, there can be some darkening of the skin. Swelling is common for a day or two following the treatment. On the other hand, microneedling side effects may include peeling, bruising, bleeding, and a risk of bacterial infection. Redness after microneedling is normal and usually lasts only a few hours, typically subsiding by the next day. Other common effects include tingling sensations and slight dryness as the skin heals and exfoliates.\nUSER: Microneedling sounds good. Can I have my routine after doing it?\nSYSTEM: Hyaluronic acid is the ultimate post-microneedling ingredient to look for, as it is a naturally occurring substance in the body known for its powerful hydrating and skin-replenishing properties. Applying hyaluronic acid after microneedling enhances its absorption, allowing the serum or treatment to penetrate deeper and work more effectively due to the temporary micro-channels created in the skin. However, it's crucial to avoid applying retinol, makeup, and strong exfoliating acids such as AHAs (alpha hydroxy acids) and BHAs (beta hydroxy acids) immediately after microneedling, as these can cause irritation or even worsen skin sensitivity. It's recommended to wait at least 24 hours post-treatment before using makeup to avoid introducing pore-clogging or irritating ingredients into freshly treated skin. If you use exfoliants containing AHAs like lactic, glycolic, or mandelic acid, apply them either the day before microneedling or wait at least two days after a session--especially when using devices like the Banisher. Additionally, while Vitamin C is a popular antioxidant, it can be sensitizing for some individuals post-microneedling, so it's best to use a gentle, naturally derived, or specifically formulated version to reduce the risk of irritation.",

Mesotherapy and microneedling are both popular skin treatments, but they work in different ways and serve slightly different purposes. Microneedling uses tiny needles to create micro-injuries in the skin, which stimulates collagen production and improves texture, scars, and fine lines. Mesotherapy, on the other hand, involves injecting a blend of vitamins, hyaluronic acid, and other nutrients directly into the skin to boost hydration, radiance, and superficial rejuvenation. If your goal is deeper skin renewal and firming, microneedling may be more effective. For added glow and hydration, mesotherapy is a great choice. Some people combine both treatments for more comprehensive results.",

Its targeted delivery system ensures active ingredients reach the scalp where they're most needed to prevent future flare-ups. 2. For a deeper clean once a week, Neutrogena Anti-Residue Shampoo works well to remove product buildup, oil, and dirt from both the scalp and hair. It has a mild, clean scent and leaves your hair feeling refreshed, though it may cause color-treated hair to fade more quickly--so it's best followed by a conditioner. 3. Kerastase Bain Divalent Shampoo is a balanced, gentle formula that cleanses oily roots while nourishing the lengths of your hair. It regulates sebum without stripping the scalp, making hair feel light, soft, and healthy. 4. If you're looking for a more affordable everyday option, L'Oreal Paris Elvive Extraordinary Clay Re-Balancing Shampoo is formulated for oily roots and dry ends. With a blend of three clays, it purifies the scalp and leaves the hair feeling soft, shiny, and bouncy, even though it doesn't lather heavily.",

Look for labels that specifically mention \"for oily hair\" or highlight oil-controlling and balancing benefits. It's also wise to consider anti-dandruff shampoos, since dandruff is not always a result of dryness; it's often triggered by microscopic fungi that thrive on excess scalp oil, leading to irritation and flaking. For a deeper cleanse, you can occasionally use a clarifying shampoo to remove buildup but limit its use to avoid over-drying or irritating the scalp.\nUSER: How about the formulation of shampoo? Should I look for any specific ingredients?\nSYSTEM: To help manage an oily scalp, look for shampoos that contain cleansing agents such as sodium lauryl sulphate, ammonium-based compounds, or other effective detergents, as these can help dry out excess oil. Sulfosuccinates are another group of detergents known for their ability to remove buildup without being overly harsh. Salicylic acid is especially effective, as it breaks down oil on the scalp more thoroughly than standard shampoo ingredients. Additionally, natural ingredients like echinacea and sage work to refresh the scalp, slough off dead skin cells, and keep pores and sweat glands clear of obstruction. Tea tree oil is also beneficial, as it actively dissolves and washes away oil and debris, promoting a cleaner and healthier scalp environment.\nUSER: I have also heard that shampoos with niacinamide and Lactic Acid or LHA are useful. Any other tips for treating it?\nSYSTEM: To manage an oily scalp, try to limit the use of heat styling tools--excessive heat can strip the scalp of its natural oils, triggering it to produce even more oil in response. When conditioning, apply a small amount only to the mid-lengths and ends of your hair--never the scalp--as this can cause buildup, greasiness, and even contribute to hair fall or bacterial growth. Washing your hair about three times per week is usually ideal: frequent cleansing helps control oil, but daily washing may overstimulate sebum production. Keep your pillowcases, bedsheets, and hairbrushes clean, as they can harbour oil and bacteria that contribute to scalp issues. Your diet also plays a key role--limit oily and fried foods and focus instead on healthy fats (like those from nuts or fish) and complex carbs to support balanced sebum levels. Would you like tips on how to incorporate niacinamide or LHA into your scalp care routine as well?\nUSER: No, that's good. Are there any specific shampoos for an oily scalp?\nSYSTEM: Is your hair also oily? Or is your hair dry?\nUSER: Both.\nSYSTEM: If you have an oily scalp and oily hair, several shampoos can help manage oil production while keeping your hair clean and balanced. 1. La Roche-Posay Kerium DS Shampoo is a great choice for oily dandruff. It gently exfoliates the scalp with LHA to remove dead skin cells and prevent flaking, while niacinamide (Vitamin B3) helps soothe itching and irritation. Its targeted delivery system ensures active ingredients reach the scalp where they're most needed to prevent future flare-ups. 2. For a deeper clean once a week, Neutrogena Anti-Residue Shampoo works well to remove product buildup, oil, and dirt from both the scalp and hair. It has a mild, clean scent and leaves your hair feeling refreshed, though it may cause color-treated hair to fade more quickly--so it's best followed by a conditioner. 3. Kerastase Bain Divalent Shampoo is a balanced, gentle formula that cleanses oily roots while nourishing the lengths of your hair. It regulates sebum without stripping the scalp, making hair feel light, soft, and healthy. 4. If you're looking for a more affordable everyday option, L'Oreal Paris Elvive Extraordinary Clay Re-Balancing Shampoo is formulated for oily roots and dry ends. With a blend of three clays, it purifies the scalp and leaves the hair feeling soft, shiny, and bouncy, even though it doesn't lather heavily.\nUSER: A couple more.\nSYSTEM: Sure, do you have any specific brands in mind?\nUSER: I heard that OUAI and Head and Shoulders might be nice.\nSYSTEM: Head & Shoulders Instant Oil Control Anti-Dandruff Shampoo is designed to tackle both oil and flakes from the very first wash. Infused with mango and citrus extracts, it leaves your scalp feeling fresh and your hair up to 100% flake-free. It uses the brand's 3-Action Formula to deeply cleanse the scalp, protect against dandruff, and lightly moisturize the hair without weighing it down--making it a solid option for oily scalps prone to dandruff. On the other hand, OUAI Detox Shampoo is a sulphate-free clarifying shampoo that offers a deeper cleanse. It's made with apple cider vinegar to dissolve excess oil, buildup, and impurities, while keratin helps strengthen and soften the hair. Free from parabens and phthalates, it's a good choice if you're looking for a more natural formula that resets your scalp without stripping it dry. Would you like to know how to alternate between different shampoos or pair them with a conditioner?\nUSER: Price\nSYSTEM: Sure, do you want me to compare the price of all 6 shampoos?",

Lavash is traditionally made with unleavened dough, while Turkish flatbread is made with yeast-leavened dough. Lavash is commonly used to wrap or scoop food, especially with kebabs.

How about bread machines?\nSYSTEM: Bread machines are smart, time-saving tools that make homemade baking easy and enjoyable. A bread machine is a compact kitchen appliance that mixes, kneads, proofs, and bakes bread automatically. It has a built-in paddle, and a bread pan inside a small oven, controlled electronically. You just add ingredients in the specified order, choose your settings (like bread type, loaf size, and crust darkness), and press Start. The machine handles everything else: preheating, kneading, rising, baking, and even keeping the bread warm. Besides bread, many machines can also make dough for pizza, pasta, pretzels, and even jam or meatloaf, depending on the model. It's designed to be a low-effort, mess-free way to enjoy homemade bread with full control over ingredients. Do you need tips on choosing the right bread machine for your needs?\nUSER: No, I'm more into baking the bread myself in the oven.\nSYSTEM: Oven baking does require more time, manual kneading (unless you use a mixer), and some experience with baking times and temperatures. But since you're passionate about the process, baking in the oven is a rewarding and customizable way to make great bread. Baking bread in the oven is often preferred for its superior flavor and texture. Oven-baked bread tends to be lighter, airier, and better for slicing compared to the denser texture of bread machine loaves. You get full control over every step of the process which appeals to many who enjoy the craft of baking. For someone who enjoys baking and likes to be challenged, baking in oven can be a rewarding experience.\nUSER: Sounds interesting. Can you suggest some recipes?\nSYSTEM: Do you have any dietary preferences (gluten-free, vegan, etc.)?\nUSER: No, I don't have any, but I prefer healthy options.\nSYSTEM: If you're looking for healthy bread options, baking at home gives you a big advantage. You can choose exactly what goes into your loaf. If you're baking in the oven and want healthy options, start with whole grains, incorporate nutritious add-ins, and choose recipes based on spelt, flax, or whole wheat flour. You'll get a healthier loaf that supports digestion, heart health, and stable energy. Some healthy bread options: Spelt Bread: made from an ancient grain with lower gluten, it's filling and has a nutty flavor; Lavash Bread: a simple flatbread made from flour, water, and salt. It's versatile and low in calories; Turkish Flatbread: low in calories and great for wraps or sandwiches; Whole Wheat Bread: a classic choice that's high in fiber and protein. Just ensure it's 100% whole wheat; Ezekiel Bread or Flax Bread: these are made from sprouted grains and seeds, offering extra fiber and nutrients.\nUSER: How do Turkish and lavash compare?\nSYSTEM: Turkish flatbread and lavash are both traditional flatbreads from the Middle East and surrounding regions, but they differ in ingredients, texture, and how they are typically used. Both are healthy, traditional options. Lavash if you want a thinner, more versatile wrap; Turkish flatbread if you're after something heartier and more filling. Lavash has deep cultural roots across Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, and Turkey, while Turkish flatbread specifically originates from Turkey and is more like a leavened, fluffy bread compared to other flatbreads. Lavash is traditionally made with unleavened dough, while Turkish flatbread is made with yeast-leavened dough. Lavash is commonly used to wrap or scoop food, especially with kebabs. Turkish flatbread, instead, is often cut open and filled like a sandwich or pita and is best eaten fresh.\nUSER: No, health\nSYSTEM: Lavash bread is made simply with flour, water, and salt. It is described as versatile, can be eaten soft or crunchy, and is used in dishes like Lavash Bread Pizza, which is referred to as \"relatively healthy.\" Turkish flatbread, although usually served as the \"unhealthy wrapper for a greasy kebab,\" is still listed among the top five healthy breads due to its low calories and versatility. It can be baked, stuffed, or grilled, and is suggested as a lower-carb option that still satisfies hunger. Additionally, you can go wholewheat with the Turkish flatbread.\nUSER: I have fatty liver.\nSYSTEM: Are you looking for dietary recommendations given your condition?\nUSER: Yes, bread\nSYSTEM: Sure, here are some general dietary information on breads, given your condition of fatty liver. You should avoid white bread, as it contains refined wheat flour, added sugars, high fructose corn syrup, and bleached flour, all of which are harmful to the liver and can spike blood sugar levels. Instead, choose whole wheat bread and bread made from whole wheat flour, which contain complex carbohydrates that are digested more slowly and have a lower impact on blood sugar; Rye bread, especially when mixed with whole wheat flour; Ketobreads (if made at home), though they are harder to prepare; Sprouted whole-grain products, such as sprouted bread, which are richer in fiber, antioxidants, and essential amino acids, and promote gut and liver health. Even healthy bread should be eaten in moderation (no more than 2-3 slices per day) to support liver recovery.\nUSER: Make it shorter.\nSYSTEM: If you have fatty liver, avoid white bread as it's made with refined, bleached flour and added sugars that harm the liver and spike blood sugar. Instead, choose: Rye bread (best when mixed with whole wheat flour); whole wheat bread; sprouted whole-grain bread; homemade ketobread (if you can make it). Eat bread in moderation (no more than 2-3 slices per day) to support liver healing.\nUSER: Ok. I have some basic tools at home. What else do I need to get?\nSYSTEM: Here's home baking must-haves. Oven: choose one that suits your needs; slightly larger is better for flexibility; kitchen weighing scale: for accurate ingredient measurements; measuring cups and spoons: essential if recipes use volume-based measurements; oven thermometer: ensures your oven heats to the correct temperature; spatula: useful for stirring, mixing, scraping, and spreading. Would you like to know about more tools?\nUSER: I have a scale and measuring cups.\nSYSTEM: Since you already have a scale and measuring cups, here are some additional tools you can get to improve your home bread baking. Oven: essential for baking; choose one slightly larger than your current needs to accommodate guests or larger recipes like a 9\" pizza; oven thermometer: because oven dials can be inaccurate, this helps ensure proper baking temperatures and prevents under- or overbaking; spatula: useful for stirring, mixing, scraping, and spreading; instant-read Thermometer: helps check dough temperature accurately, which is important for consistent results; foldable dough proofer: keeps dough warm and supports good fermentation, especially helpful for sourdough baking.

        "context": "USER: Hey, I was diagnosed with ADHD a few months ago. Can you help me manage it at work?\nSYSTEM: Of course! ADHD can affect work in various ways - from distractibility and time management to organisation and task completion. Since you work in an office, some of these challenges might feel more pronounced. One of the most common treatments for ADHD in Germany is medication, but there are also many strategies you can use to manage symptoms in the workplace. What specific challenges are you facing at work that you'd like to address first? For example, is it difficult to focus due to office distractions, managing time, or something else?\nUSER: My office is pretty quiet, so distractions aren't really a problem. There are so many tasks to do that I constantly feel overwhelmed.\nSYSTEM: I understand. Feeling overwhelmed by a large workload is definitely something many people with ADHD experience. There are several strategies that can help manage this feeling. One of the most effective approaches is to break down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. This way, you can tackle each part without feeling overwhelmed by the whole task. Would you like to explore some specific techniques for breaking down tasks, or perhaps discuss how to prioritize them effectively?\nUSER: Won't that just create even more tasks to do?\nSYSTEM: That is a valid concern. However, the idea isn't to create more work - it's about dividing one big overwhelming task into smaller, concrete steps. The key to feeling less overwhelmed is to make each step as specific as possible. For example, instead of \"write report,\" you could break it down into \"collect data\", \"create a draft\", \"write introduction\", etc. This way, each step feels more achievable. Would you like me to help you come up with a specific example based on your current tasks at work?\nUSER: Hm, not sure about that. My main problem is that if I have more than one task at hand, I just can't properly focus on any of them. I end up jumping from one task to another without finishing anything.\nSYSTEM: Ah, that sounds like you're experiencing \"ADHD paralysis\", where your brain gets stuck between tasks and can't initiate any of them. It's less about the number of tasks and more about the executive function challenge of choosing one and sticking with it. This is a frustrating experience, but there are strategies that can help you manage it. One effective approach is to work with your ADHD rather than against it. Since focusing on one task for a long time can be difficult, try choosing two tasks you need to get done and switching between them throughout the day. This can boost your productivity because when your attention starts to wane on one task, you can shift to the other. Have you ever tried using a timer to dedicate a short burst of focus to a single task?\nUSER: How exactly does that work?\nSYSTEM: A great starting point is the Pomodoro Technique: you set a timer for 15-25 minutes of focused work on one single task. If a distracting thought pops up, just jot it down on a notepad to deal with later and gently guide your focus back to the task. When the timer goes off, you take a 5-minute break. This can be especially helpful in a sedentary office job, as you can use that break to stand up and stretch. These breaks also provide a natural opportunity to switch tasks if you feel your focus waning. After four Pomodoros, you take a longer break of 15-30 minutes. This way, you're not just working continuously but also allowing your brain to reset.\nUSER: It's a bit too strict. Sometimes I don't want to interrupt my hyperfocus with a timer. Any other suggestions?\nSYSTEM: Absolutely. Finding your \"flow\" or hyperfocus is a superpower, and you don't want to interrupt it unnecessarily. In that case, you can try experimenting and finding what works for you, rather than rigidly adhering to someone else's system.

It's a bit like choosing the right brush for a painting! Tattoo needles are generally categorized by their configuration (grouping). There are Round Liners (RL), Round Shaders (RS), Stacked Magnum (M1), Round Magnum and Flat Needles. Round Liners are primarily used for outlining the design. They come in various sizes, affecting the thickness of the line. These include 3RL, 5RL, 7RL, and even larger groupings, with the number indicating how many needles are in the grouping. Round Shaders are designed for shading or colouring between the lines of the RL outline. Similar to RL, they come in different sizes, like 5RS or 7RS. Stacked Magnum are best suited for blending and shading smaller areas while Round Magnum are for colouring in larger areas without overworking the skin. Finally, Flat Needles are used for shapes and intricate shading, like geometric designs or bold lines. As a hobbyist, starting with a few common types like a 3RL or 5RL for lines, and a 7RS or 9M1 for shading, would give you a good range to experiment with on your fake skin.

        "context": "USER: How can I get started with tattooing?\nSYSTEM: That's exciting that you're looking into tattooing! Getting into tattooing in Germany can be a bit different from other countries, as there isn't a standardized \"apprenticeship\" system like in some trades. However, there are clear ways to get started. Start by researching tattooing techniques and styles. There are many online resources, including tutorials and courses, that can help you understand the basics. In addition to your tattoo machine and fake skin, make sure you have all necessary supplies, including needles, ink, and hygiene products. Use your fake skin to practice different techniques. Focus on line work, shading, and color packing to build your skills. Tattooing requires strict hygiene practices to prevent infections. Learn about proper sterilization techniques and how to maintain a clean workspace. In Germany, you need to be aware of the legal requirements for tattooing, including health regulations and hygiene standards. Make sure to familiarize yourself with these before starting. Given your sedentary office job, getting into tattooing could offer a fantastic creative outlet and a more active, hands-on career. It's also a field where your ADHD might even be an advantage, as the intense focus and hyperfixation often associated with it could be channeled into mastering intricate designs and techniques.

I already have a tattoo machine and some fake skin. Anything else I need to get started?\nSYSTEM: Got it! Since you can draw well, you're already on the right track. In addition to your tattoo machine and fake skin, you'll need some basic supplies, including tattoo needles, ink, and a power supply for your machine. It's also important to have proper hygiene supplies like gloves, disinfectant, and a clean workspace to ensure safety and cleanliness while tattooing. For transferring designs, you might want to get some stencil paper and, optionally, a thermal printer. If you're new to tattooing, it might be helpful to start with some online tutorials or courses that cover the basics of tattooing techniques, needle types, and skin preparation. Practicing on fake skin is a great way to build your skills before moving on to real skin. Would you like more information on any specific aspect, like needle types?\nUSER: Yes please.\nSYSTEM: Understanding tattoo needle types is crucial for achieving different effects in your artwork, even on fake skin. It's a bit like choosing the right brush for a painting! Tattoo needles are generally categorized by their configuration (grouping). There are Round Liners (RL), Round Shaders (RS), Stacked Magnum (M1), Round Magnum and Flat Needles. Round Liners are primarily used for outlining the design. They come in various sizes, affecting the thickness of the line. These include 3RL, 5RL, 7RL, and even larger groupings, with the number indicating how many needles are in the grouping. Round Shaders are designed for shading or colouring between the lines of the RL outline. Similar to RL, they come in different sizes, like 5RS or 7RS. Stacked Magnum are best suited for blending and shading smaller areas while Round Magnum are for colouring in larger areas without overworking the skin. Finally, Flat Needles are used for shapes and intricate shading, like geometric designs or bold lines. As a hobbyist, starting with a few common types like a 3RL or 5RL for lines, and a 7RS or 9M1 for shading, would give you a good range to experiment with on your fake skin. Focus on understanding how each type feels and how it deposits ink, and you'll quickly develop a feel for what works best for different design elements.\nUSER: Where can I get these?\nSYSTEM: Great question!

It ensures that chemicals used in products, including tattoo inks and needles, are safe for human health and the environment. When a product is REACH compliant, it means that it has been tested and meets the safety standards set by the EU. This is particularly important in tattooing, as the inks and materials used can have direct contact with the skin. Using REACH compliant products helps ensure that you are using safe and regulated materials, which is especially crucial when you eventually move from practicing on fake skin to real skin.",

First, the shape of the saddle really matters. Mountain biking involves a lot of movement and shifting positions, especially on rough or hilly terrain. A narrower saddle helps with maneuverability, while a wider rear provides better support for your sit bones. You'll want something that balances both. Also, durability and weather resistance are important, especially since you ride in the rain and on forest paths. Look for a weatherproof cover that won't get slick or degrade quickly in wet conditions. Saddle height and positioning also play a role in comfort. If you're riding cross-country, a slightly higher saddle can help with pedaling efficiency. For more technical trails or downhill rides, a lower saddle improves control. You might even want to consider a dropper post if you're doing both. Finally, padding isn't everything, comfort also depends on how well the saddle fits your body and riding style.

        "context": "USER: Hi! I bought a second-hand bike last week. I want to inspect and upgrade a few parts, what do you suggest I check first?\nSYSTEM: When checking a second-hand bike, start by making sure the wheels aren't bent and that the seat and rear frame are properly aligned with the rest of the bike. You should also check that the front part, especially the headlight, is pointing straight. If anything looks misaligned, like the steering or rear wheel being off by a centimeter or so, it's best to get it repaired or replaced safely. Used bikes can also have issues with the swingarm, so it's good to be cautious there too. If you're unsure, a mechanic can do a full check-up and give you a written report (usually around $250) confirming everything is in good shape. That might be a good option for you, especially since you mentioned you're not very handy with DIY. By the way, what kind of bike is it, mountain, road, or city? And how much did you pay for it?\nUSER: It's a mountain bike. I mainly use it on forest trails or rough bike paths. The alignment looks fine, but the saddle is very uncomfortable. Can you tell me more about saddle types?\nSYSTEM: Bike seats or saddles generally come with one of two types of cushioning including gel or memory foam. Gel bike seats (or seat covers) are softer and provide better initial comfort. Memory foam seats take some more time to get used to but provide better overall comfort on long rides. Do you want to know more about any of these seats?\nUSER: The one I have now feels like bare plastic, very harsh. The first one you propose seems interesting. Is it good for me?\nSYSTEM: A gel bike seat contains one or two bladders that are filled with a flexible, elastic gel. Gel saddles and gel seat covers are quite soft and provide a high degree of comfort. If you are someone who rides on average less than an hour and only a few times a week, then you need something that can cushion the sit bones and contours better to the shape of your body. Therefore, for beginners and casual riders like you, gel bike seats may be the right choice. In your case you can also buy a seat cushion that you can add on top of the saddle, it is usually cheaper with good comfort.\nUSER: You just mentioned its benefits. What about its drawbacks? Also for the cushion one, I always find out they slip off, making it super uncomfortable.\nSYSTEM: Professional and advanced level cyclists avoid gel bike seats because it becomes uncomfortable on long rides. Also, it loses spring-back property more quickly. The gel tends to get compacted and loses its shape faster than foam. Concerning the one that you add over the seat, some have side strings that are tied to the seat pole to enhance the fit. Some also have an anti-slip texture as an interior design, which fixes it to the bike seat without chances of sliding off.\nUSER: I like the softness of gel seats. It is very important to me to feel comfortable; I used to have back pain a lot. So let me consider a gel cushion adds-on seat. Are there any other important features to consider?\nSYSTEM: Since you ride a mountain bike and comfort is a top priority, especially with your history of back pain, there are several features beyond foam or gel that are worth considering when choosing a saddle. First, the shape of the saddle really matters. Mountain biking involves a lot of movement and shifting positions, especially on rough or hilly terrain. A narrower saddle helps with maneuverability, while a wider rear provides better support for your sit bones. You'll want something that balances both. Also, durability and weather resistance are important, especially since you ride in the rain and on forest paths. Look for a weatherproof cover that won't get slick or degrade quickly in wet conditions. Saddle height and positioning also play a role in comfort. If you're riding cross-country, a slightly higher saddle can help with pedaling efficiency. For more technical trails or downhill rides, a lower saddle improves control. You might even want to consider a dropper post if you're doing both. Finally, padding isn't everything, comfort also depends on how well the saddle fits your body and riding style. Many mountain bike saddles are designed to support the sit bones while staying streamlined enough for effective pedaling. Would you like some help narrowing it down to a few specific models?\nUSER: I meant other than the seat.\nSYSTEM: For better comfort, would you like to explore things like suspension, handlebar setup, or maybe adjusting your tire pressure?\nUSER: I know about tire pressure, but for the hands yes.\nSYSTEM: For mountain biking, the handlebar setup has a big impact on comfort and control. The right width, rise, and sweep can improve posture, reduce wrist strain, and make technical terrain easier to handle. Wider bars offer more stability for downhill or fast trails, while shorter bars help with tight turns. Riser bars give you a more upright position, great if you've had back pain, and a comfortable sweep keeps your wrists in a natural position. Handlebars are usually made of carbon or aluminum. Carbon absorbs more vibrations for added comfort, while aluminum is more durable and budget-friendly. Combined with good grips, the right handlebar setup can make your rides much more enjoyable.\nUSER: Interesting, I will probably consider buying a new grip. By the way, I am not sure about the material of my bike, how to know exactly? And where are we now about budget?\nSYSTEM: To find out what material your bike is made of, start by checking the weight, it can give you a clue. Carbon fiber components are very light, strong, and absorb vibrations well, often found on high-end bikes. Aluminium is the most common frame material, known for being both durable and lightweight. Steel is heavier but very strong and offers a smooth ride. Sometimes, especially on road bikes, the fork might be made of a different material than the frame, so check that too. Look for labels on the frame or handlebar or check the manufacturer's website for exact details. About the budget, you can get a new grip for around 10 to 20 euros, and a gel bike cushion seat for also around 20 to 30 euros.\nUSER: I have been thinking about my plastic pedals too.\nSYSTEM: That makes sense, plastic pedals can wear down quickly and get slippery, especially in wet or muddy conditions. For mountain biking, flat platform pedals made from aluminum or magnesium are a solid upgrade. They typically have metal traction pins that dig into your shoe soles, giving you way more grip and control. They also hold up better to impacts from rocks or roots. If you want something that balances grip, durability, and ease of use, flat pedals with sealed bearings and a wide platform are a great choice.\nUSER: That sounds good, what are the key things to look for?\nSYSTEM: A few things really matter when choosing flat pedals. First, go for a robust body material, aluminum and magnesium offer better strength-to-weight ratios than plastic. Second, look for replaceable metal pins; they provide superior grip, and you can swap them out if they wear down. You'll also want sealed bearings or bushings, which protect against dirt and moisture, especially if you ride through wet forests or muddy trails. Lastly, check the platform size, a wider platform gives more stability, especially with trail or downhill shoes. If you can, try a model with slightly concave shape, it helps lock your foot in place naturally.",

This can be adjusted easily, just check limit screws labelled \"H\" and \"L\" for \"High\" and \"Low\" limits.\nUSER: I just checked, the derailleur seems to be fine, it is well aligned with each gear, and it doesn't go too far on the right or on the left after shifting the speed. Maybe it is related to the chain then?\nSYSTEM: Indeed, related to the chain it might be wear, or the chain being not on the correct length. It can also be the teeth of your cassette being damaged. Can you tell me more about your bike, did you buy it recently? or changed some parts recently?\nUSER: I bought this bike one month ago, the chain was changed when I bought it, and the gear don't look damaged.\nSYSTEM: Then it is probably not worn, and more likely a problem of chain length. The next step would be to check the length of the chain. To do that, go on the largest chairing and largest cog, you should be able to do the shift easily. On the other side, go on the smallest cog, there you should see that the jockey still has some tension. Let me know once you did those two steps if you notice something abnormal.\nUSER: Wait, what is the jockey?\nSYSTEM: Your rear derailleur features an upper and a lower jockey wheel, and these perform different jobs. The upper jockey wheel, also known as the guide pulley, is the one that is in charge of shifting duties when you change speed. The lower jockey wheel is also known as the tension pulley, because it helps to keep the chain tensioned in each gear combination. Both are two small wheels next to your gears on the back wheel.\nUSER: I tried to go on the largest gears, and I see that the chain seems a bit loose. How to know the perfect length?\nSYSTEM: If your chain feels loose on the largest gears, it might be too long. One way to check the ideal chain length is by using this formula: L = 2(C) + (F/4 + R/4 + 1) where: L is the chain length in inches, C is the distance from the crank center to the rear axle (the chain stay), F is the number of teeth on the largest front chainring, R is the number of teeth on the largest rear cog. You can measure the chain stay and count the teeth on your gears to calculate it. Let me know if you'd like help doing this step by step or identifying these parts on your bike.\nUSER: I'm not good with math\nSYSTEM: Ok. here is another more hands-on method, also very reliable, called the big-big method. You can remove your chain from the gears, and from the derailleur, then wrap the chain against the largest front chainring and rear cog, skipping the derailleur, and then pull it tight. This gives you the reference length, on which you can add two extra links. Do you have a chain breaker tool to do it? I would also advise you to use a bike repair stand if you have one, it might avoid you some back pain.\nUSER: That's much better, thanks, yes I have a chain breaker, but you can remind me how to use it, and also how to open my chain?\nSYSTEM: You should be able to identify a master link on your chain - a special link that join the two ends of the chain. Once you identified the master link, you can open your chain, then use the chain breaker to remove the number of links you need. To remove the links, you just need to align the chain breaker with a pivot/pin or a link and then push the pin out, once the pin is out, the link will automatically drop.",

        "context": "USER: Hi, my bike chain keeps going out, what is the issue?\nSYSTEM: There is probably an issue with your chain, or gears, would you like a DIY guide, or do you prefer to go to a bike shop for them to fix it?\nUSER: I rather fix it myself, I have some tools, and some time.\nSYSTEM: There are lots of reasons why your chain could be jumping off, or even going out. First, it can be just common wear, if you had your bike for long time, it is normal you need to change the chains regularly. It is especially true if you bike in rainy weather or mud. Another reason could also be the derailleur. When you change speed, the derailleur shifts the chain, if it is not well adjusted it can go too far in one direction, or even still shift it although there is no gear to catch it.

What should I use to lubricate my chain now? Can I use car oil?\nSYSTEM: You could use motor oil, but it is not the ideal case because bike and car oils have different properties. Car motor oil is made to resist to extreme temperature, while bike grease needs to resist to water. If you apply your grease correctly, you could easily bike for 200 miles without any problem, while with poor quality oil, you might have to do extra maintenance.",
