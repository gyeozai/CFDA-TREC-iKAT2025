Butter is also higher in calories and lower in trans fats than vegetable oil.

Butter is a solid fat, while vegetable oil is liquid, so they have different effects on the consistency and texture of the food. Butter is also higher in calories and lower in trans fats than vegetable oil. If you want to use butter instead of vegetable oil, you may need to adjust the quantity, melt it down, and let it cool a bit. For example, 1 cup of butter equals 7/8 cup of vegetable oil.", "I see, thanks! What are some cheese substitutes?", "I can suggest some alternatives for feta cheese. One option is to use a lower fat cheese like mozzarella. Another is to use a plant-based cheese substitute, if you're open to vegan options. You could also try adding a bit of nutritional yeast for a cheese-like flavor with less fat and more protein.", "Can you compare the first two?", "Mozzarella cheese is a dairy product derived from milk and produced in a wide range of flavors. It comprises fat, usually from the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. On the other hand, vegan cheese is a non-dairy, plant-based product. Vegan cheese is 100 percent animal-free cheese and is made using vegetable proteins. The ingredients of vegan cheese include soy, nuts, cashews, and vegetable oils (such as coconut oil). Vegan cheese is made using a process similar to traditional cheese making-without the animal milk. During the process, the plant proteins are separated using bacteria. Then the ingredients, such as oils and thickeners, are added to achieve the desired cheese-like consistency.", "Which of these is suitable for me?", "Based on the nutritional facts, mozzarella can be considered safe for lactose-intolerant people to eat, but be aware that the type of mozzarella you buy may not help reduce your symptoms. This is because many types of processed and packaged mozzarella also contain whey powder or casein - two other forms of dairy which are high in lactose. However, mozzarella has almost no lactose. Just one ounce of cheese provides around 0.3 grams of lactose. Vegan cheese is also a good alternative for lactose-intolerant people. Vegan cheeses are 100 percent animal-free and made using vegetable proteins. There are many different types of vegan cheese available, including vegan mozzarella. So, both mozzarella and vegan cheese can be suitable for lactose-intolerant people. It depends on your personal preference and dietary needs.", "Thanks! I'm also not sure about the yeast. How does it taste and where can I buy it?", "Nutritional yeast has a nutty, cheesy flavor which makes it a popular cheese substitute among vegans and health-conscious eaters.

As you are interested in the nutritional value of the food, let me compare them on this bases. Both ricotta cheese and cottage cheese are high in vitamins, minerals, and nutrients. Ricotta is higher in calcium, zinc, fats, and cholesterol, while cottage cheese is higher in sugars and sodium. Some of this is caused by cottage cheese having a slightly higher water content. However, the nutrition of cottage cheese varies based on the milkfat percentage used. If you are looking to save some calories, it is worth considering substituting ricotta for cottage cheese where appropriate. However, cottage cheese is loaded with sodium compared to ricotta cheese. Ricotta cheese may be the better option if you are concerned about your daily sodium intake.", "Are they okay for me?", "If you are referring to your lactose intolerance, based on my sources, ricotta cheese, particularly fresh ricotta, contains less lactose than other dairy products because the enzymes used in the cheese-making process help digest some of the lactose before it enters the digestive system. However, the lactose content may vary depending on the specific brand or homemade recipe. Cottage cheese also contains lactose since it is made from milk, which is the primary source of lactose. The average lactose percentage in cottage cheese ranges from slightly over 2% to slightly over 3%, making it tolerable for many people with lactose sensitivity or intolerance. LACTAID offers a low-fat cottage cheese option that contains lactase, a natural enzyme that helps break down lactose and make it easier to digest for individuals with lactose intolerance.

There are many cooking techniques that can make meals healthier. Here are a few: 1. Steaming: This method retains most of the nutrients in your food and requires no added fat. 2. Grilling: Great for proteins and vegetables. It adds flavor and allows fat to drip away from the food. 3. Roasting: You can roast vegetables, meats, and fish. It brings out the natural flavors and is a healthy way to cook. 4. Sauteing: Using a small amount of oil or broth can make this a healthy option. It's quick and retains the nutrients in your food. 5. Baking: Instead of frying, try baking for a healthier alternative. Steaming is one of the healthiest techniques used in cooking, so I suggest you try steaming your food the next time.", "How is steaming different from grilling? Which one is healthier?", "Steaming and grilling are two different cooking methods. Steaming is a moist heat cooking method that employs hot steam to conduct the heat to the food, without disturbing it in a boiling liquid. When cooking meats such as lamb or pork, steaming removes the fat from the meat so it can be easily discarded whereas conventional cooking methods such as grilling, baking, or frying, cook the fat into the meat. Getting rid of the fat makes the meat lower in calories and lower in cholesterol. Also, steaming removes the need for cooking oil or fat, which results in lighter and healthier meals", "Thanks! Could you elaborate on how to properly saute food?", "Absolutely! Sauteing is a quick, efficient method of cooking food at relatively high temperatures. Here's a basic process: 1. Heat the Pan: Start by heating a pan over medium-high heat. You want the pan to be hot, but not smoking. 2. Add Oil or Broth: Once the pan is heated, add a small amount of oil or broth. Allow it to heat up until it shimmers or if using broth, until it starts to steam. 3. Add the Food: Add your ingredients in a single layer. They should sizzle when they hit the pan. 4. Stir or Toss the Food: Keep the food moving for even cooking. You can stir, or toss the food with a flick of the wrist. 5. Cook to Desired Doneness: Depending on the food, this may take anywhere from 1 to 10 minutes. 6. Remove From Heat: Once your food is cooked to your liking, remove it from the heat immediately to prevent overcooking. Does this help clarify the process of sauteing for you?", "Yes, it does. Can I do it without oil?", "Yes, you can saute without oil. One common method is to use broth or water instead. Start with a small amount, enough to cover the bottom of the pan, and add more as needed to prevent the food from sticking. You could also use a non-stick pan to reduce the need for oil. However, keep in mind that you might not achieve the exact same browning or crisping effect that you would with oil.", "I don't like this. I think I will stick to using a little bit of oil. Is there healthy oil?", "You can also saute with oil but use healthier oil. Here are a few suggestions: 1.

{"sample_id": "10-2_15", "context": ["Can you tell me about some ingredients that I can use in my dishes?", "There are many unique ingredients that you can use to experiment with your gourmet dishes. Some examples of gourmet ingredients that can add unique flavors and textures to your dishes include lemon olive oil spray, black truffle balsamic glaze, black garlic, and Calvi white wine vinegar. These ingredients blend herbs and spices in interesting ways or add flavor to foods that are usually not flavored. You can also try incorporating some unique proteins into your dishes, such as crab, scallops, mussels, or oysters. For example, you could make a macaroni and cheese dish with succulent lump crabmeat and melty Brie, or serve crispy fried oysters with a cornmeal batter.", "Thanks for the information. How would the garlic be different from the limes?", "Black garlic and finger limes are two very different ingredients that can be used to add unique flavors to your gourmet dishes. Black garlic is a type of aged garlic that has a sweet and savory flavor with notes of molasses, chocolate, and dried fruit, coupled with tangy hints of balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, and tamarind. On the other hand, finger limes are a citrus fruit native to Australia that are small and elongated, almost resembling gherkins. They contain tiny spherical vessels filled with tart juice that is sometimes called citrus caviar. Finger limes have a tart, citrusy flavor with a rosemary-like herbaceous note along with a somewhat minty flavor. While black garlic can be used to add depth and complexity to various dishes, finger limes can be used to add a fresh, tart citrus flavor to fish and seafood dishes as well as salads and desserts.", "And how is it different from garlic? Would it make a difference to my dishes?", "Using raw garlic instead of black garlic would result in a very different flavor profile in your gourmet dishes. Raw garlic has a pungent and spicy flavor that can be quite strong and overpowering if not used carefully. On the other hand, black garlic has a sweet and savory flavor with notes of molasses, chocolate, and dried fruit, coupled with tangy hints of balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, and tamarind. Black garlic is also soft and tender in texture and can easily be spread with a knife or blended into a paste. Using raw garlic instead of black garlic would result in a sharper and more pungent flavor in your dishes.", "Interesting. How can I use it?", "I am sorry, but do you mean raw garlic or black garlic?", "I mean black garlic.", "Black garlic has a soft, molasses-like flavor, with a slightly tangy garlic undertone that can enhance a variety of dishes. Here are a few ways to use black garlic in your gourmet dishes: 1. Sauces and Marinades: Black garlic can be pureed with some olive oil and then mixed into sauces or used as a marinade for meats. 2. Dressings: Mix it into dressings for salads or roasted vegetables. 3. Pasta: It can be incorporated into pasta dishes, perhaps in a black garlic butter sauce. 4. Risottos: Black garlic can add depth to the flavors of a risotto. Remember, black garlic is quite different from raw garlic. Its flavor is deep, sweet, and complex, so it's often best to start with a small amount and add more to taste.", "Thanks for that information. Could you give me more details on how to prepare and store it?", "When you're preparing black garlic, there isn't much that you need to do. The cloves are soft and can be easily squashed or pureed without any prior preparation. You can also slice them if you'd prefer to have pieces of black garlic in your dish. As for storage, black garlic should be stored in a cool, dry place and away from direct sunlight. It can be kept at room temperature and doesn't need to be refrigerated. Once you've opened a bulb of black garlic, it's best to use it within a week or so, as it can dry out over time. However, if kept unopened, it can last for several months. You can also freeze black garlic if you'd like to keep it for longer periods.", "How can I tell if it has gone bad or spoiled?", "To determine if black garlic has gone bad or spoiled, you can look for the following signs: (1) Spots on the surface: If the black garlic has gone bad, it may develop brown spots on its surface, and the color can change from off-white to yellowish tan. (2) Sprouts formation: When black garlic goes bad, green sprouts may start to grow in the center of the cloves. These sprouts can taste bitter and should be removed. (3) Squeeze test: A clear indication that black garlic has gone bad is when it becomes soft or malleable when squeezed. This change in texture signifies spoilage.", "Thanks for that information, it's really useful. Now, I have heard about the Sous vide cooking technique. Tell me more about it.", "Sous-vide (French for 'under vacuum') is a method of cooking in which food is placed in a plastic pouch or a glass jar and cooked in a water bath for longer than usual cooking times (usually 1 to 7 hours, up to 48 or more in some cases) at an accurately regulated temperature. The water temperature is well below simmering, anywhere from 125 degrees F to 195 degrees F. This method of cooking is characterized by low-temperature cooking, a longer period of cooking than conventional cooking, and a container (such as a plastic bag) that separates the food from its heating environment.

In terms of sheer number of apps, Android is the frontrunner, but that's not necessarily a good thing.", "Is Android helpful for my business?", "In the simplest terms, based on most reviews, the iPhone takes the edge here because there's no such thing as a bad camera in a reasonably current iPhone. That said, given the sheer amount of choice in Android handsets, there is room for photo specialists. Plus, in broad strokes, any Android phone with a price tag of, say, $300 or more is going to take great pictures.", "I did not mean camera quality, what about photo editing apps?", "Apologies. In Android, Google Photos offers almost everything you'd want in a photo service. It combines effortless backup and photo sharing with powerful, easy-to-use editing tools to create an essential photography tool for an Android phone. In iOS Apple Photos comes with a rich of editing tools. Moreover, Adobe Photoshop Express is available on both Android and iPhone.", "Ok, nice. Let's compare the hardware.", "According to most tech reports, iPhone hardware is really good! If you wonder why iPhone is so expensive, the answer is that the top quality hardware is used to assemble an iPhone. And of course, quality comes at a price. Android phones are made by loads of manufacturers and they all offer phones based on all sorts of hardware configurations. Premium-priced Android phones are about as good as the iPhone, but cheaper Androids are more prone to problems.", "How about the battery life?", "I have found a comparison between iPhone X and some other Android phones which is done in 2018. In this comparison, Tom's Guide tested the battery life of iPhone X and XS (Max) which are the two best phones from Apple in terms of battery life, and various Android smartphones after continuous web browsing. For this test, the brightness was set to 150 nits with auto-brightness and True Tone options disabled. By comparison, the iPhone X beat Apple's latest flagship devices by hitting 10 hours and 49 minutes in a similar test a year ago. Android smartphones smoke the XS Unsurprisingly, Android smartphones have a significant lead over the current iPhone generation. The first three places are occupied by Huawei P20 Pro, Google Pixel 2 XL, and Samsung Galaxy Note 9. Their batteries have more capacity than that of iPhones. The battery of the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max offers 2,658 mAh and 3,174 mAh respectively. In contrast, Android devices are equipped with an average of 3,500 to 4,000 mAh batteries. Even the energy-saving modes of the A12 Bionic chipset integrated into the new iPhones cannot fully compensate for the battery disadvantage compared to the competition.", "Ok, we have a clear winner. Android phone it is. Which brands are the best and most affordable ones?", "Samsung, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, Huawei, and One Plus are some of the best Android phone brands that offer very good affordable phone models.", "Hmm, nice. Give me some models then.", "Since you are in the industry of photography and design. Here are some phones with the best design from the abovementioned brands. 1) The Oppo Find X3 Pro, 2) the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra, 3) the Vivo X60 Pro Plus, and 4) the Galaxy Z Flip 3 are some of the phone models that have very good design.", "Let's do a quick budget check. Tell me their price. Also, sort them based on price.", "According to my sources, the retail price of these phones in the US is as follows. The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra starts from $718.00, the Vivo X60 Pro Plus is priced at $953, the Galaxy Z Flip 3 is priced at $999, Oppo Find X3 Pro has an estimated price of $1118.", "Ok. Is the cheapest one good for me? Will it be enough for my work and daily usage?", "The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra Camera Specs 50 MP, f/2.0, 24mm (wide), 1/1.12'', 1.4um, Dual Pixel PDAF, Laser AF, OIS 48 MP, f/4.1, 120mm (periscope telephoto), 1/2.0'', 0.8um, PDAF, OIS, 5x optical zoom 48 MP, f/2.2, 12mm, 128@ (ultrawide), 1/2.0'', 0.8um, PDAF As you can see, unlike most Android phones - and the iPhone - the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra has massively powerful camera sensors across the board. The other technical specs are great, Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 888 CPU, 12GB of RAM, a gorgeous 6.81in AMOLED display, and a 5000mAh battery.

But do you have a specific budget in mind?", "I think I am willing to spend a maximum amount of $250.", "And do you want to upgrade to a new iPhone?", "Yes.", "Sure, I can help you here. The latest version of the iPhone is iPhone 14. The starting price is $850. Based on the budget that you have considered, I suggest you try iPhone 8. You can buy it from Amazon. Amazon has two product grades: Renewed and Renewed Premium. Renewed is the cheapest option and starts at $170 for an iPhone 8 with 64GB storage, while Renewed Premium is a bit more expensive.", "That sounds great! Can you tell me the basic differences between the two?", "Amazon says that its Renewed devices have no \"visible cosmetic imperfections\" when held at an arm's length and a battery capacity that exceeds 80 percent relative to a new device, while Renewed Premium versions are \"certified to work and look like new,\"", "Ok, I think I will stick with renewed. So how is my current iPhone 5s different from this one?", "The iPhone 8 is a significant upgrade from the iPhone 5s. It features a larger 4.7-inch display compared to the 4-inch display of the 5s. It also includes wireless charging thanks to the glass-back design. As you are specifically interested in the processor and the camera, you should know that the iPhone 8 has an A11 Bionic processor which is faster and more efficient than the A7 processor in the 5s. The iPhone 8 camera has been improved for better color accuracy and low-light performance. Finally, the iPhone 8 supports Augmented Reality (AR) features.", "Tell me more about the two processors. How much faster is the new one?", "The Apple A7 has 2 cores with 2 threads and clocks with a maximum frequency of 1.40 GHz. Up to 1 GB of memory is supported in 1 memory channel. On the other hand, the Apple A11 Bionic has 6 cores with 6 threads and clocks with a maximum frequency of 2.39 GHz. The CPU supports up to 3 GB of memory in 1 memory channel. The A11 Bionic processor in the iPhone 8 is approximately 50% faster than the A7 processor in the iPhone 5s.", "That sounds great! And what about the camera?", "The iPhone 8 camera is a significant upgrade over the one in iPhone 5s. iPhone 8 has a 12-megapixel rear camera with an f/1.8, 28mm (wide) aperture and can shoot 4K videos. In contrast, the iPhone 5s features an 8-megapixel rear camera with an f/2.2, 29mm (standard) aperture. The larger aperture and optical image stabilization of the iPhone 8's camera should result in better low-light performance and less blur in photos.", "That's great. But is the Plus better for me?", "In terms of camera, The iPhone 8 Plus has a more advanced camera system than the iPhone 8. While both phones have a 12-megapixel camera with a f/1.8 aperture, PDAF, and OIS, the iPhone 8 Plus has an additional 12-megapixel telephoto camera with a f/2.8 aperture and 2x optical zoom. This second camera allows the iPhone 8 Plus to take portrait shots with a depth-of-field effect that can add drama to photos. In terms of processing power, both phones have the same A11 Bionic processor. However, the iPhone 8 Plus has an extra gigabyte of memory to help with multitasking.", "Hmm, I think I might go with the Plus model. Would it be suitable for me?", "As you are conscious of the money you spend on this upgrade, I think you would like to know that the iPhone 8 Plus is more costly than the iPhone 8 model. The price difference varies depending on several factors such as storage size, condition, and whether or not it is connected to a carrier. The iPhone 8 starts at $189 on Amazon while the iPhone 8 Plus starts at $197.", "Thanks for that information. The difference doesn't seem too much though. By the way, where are they made?", "iPhones are designed by Apple in California, but their components come from various manufacturers all over the world. The final assembly of iPhones mostly takes place in China, where factories operated by manufacturing partners such as Foxconn are located. However, Apple has also started to move some production to other countries like India and Vietnam. Is there anything else you would like to know?", "What did they do for sustainability?", "Apple has made a commitment to become carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030. The company is already carbon neutral for its global corporate operations, and this new commitment means that by 2030, every Apple device sold will have net zero climate impact.", "Can you provide more details about the Impact Accelerator and how it supports minority-owned businesses?", "The Impact Accelerator is a program launched by Apple as part of its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative. It aims to support and empower minority-owned businesses, specifically Black-, Brown-, Native American, and Indigenous-owned businesses, in the green technology and clean energy sectors. The program is designed to combat systemic barriers to opportunity and promote equity while addressing the urgent challenges posed by climate change. The selected businesses participating in the Impact Accelerator receive customized training and have access to Apple experts and an alumni community. The program supports these businesses in achieving their next stage of development by providing resources, mentorship, and networking opportunities. Apple also considers these companies as potential suppliers, aligning with its goal to become carbon neutral for its supply chain and products by 2030. The businesses selected for the Impact Accelerator are diverse in their areas of focus, ranging from energy efficiency, solar, green chemistry, recycling, and other environmental sectors. Many of these companies have a specific commitment to bringing clean energy, opportunity, and vital services to vulnerable and underserved communities.", "Do other phone companies do the same?", "Yes, according to their reports, other phone companies are also taking steps to improve their sustainability. For example, Fairphone is dedicated to creating smartphones that are sustainable and high-quality. It regularly receives top marks from environmental groups for its clean supply chains and sustainable materials. Fairphone uses a modular design so that its hardware lasts as long as possible and can be upgraded through new software instead of making customers buy a completely new phone. Customers can map the journey of their smartphone and see the exact suppliers for each part, as well as recycle old devices for credit on new Fairphones. Similarly, in 2019, Samsung made the switch to recycled and sustainably sourced packaging, and it is moving away from disposable materials in its manufacturing and packaging efforts. It has a goal to recycle 7.5 billion pounds of electronic waste by 2030. Samsung is on track to use 100% renewable energy in the U.S. by the end of 2020. Samsung is also committed to a wide range of global social initiatives, including protecting the ecosystem and taking urgent action against climate change.", "That's good to know. I was wondering if it is safe to buy a refurbished one in the first place.", "Reading from multiple sources of information, it appears to be generally safe to buy a refurbished iPhone. However, the level of safety and quality assurance can depend on where you're purchasing the device. iPhones refurbished by Apple go through a rigorous refurbishment process, including cleaning, replacing essential parts, and adding a new external shell. Apple guarantees these iPhones to be of the same quality as new ones. However, iPhones refurbished by third parties might use parts not sourced from Apple, making them cheaper but potentially less reliable. Therefore, it is advised to be extra careful when buying an iPhone not refurbished by Apple itself. Regardless of where the refurbished iPhone is purchased, it's crucial to buy from a store that offers refund and warranty policies, so you can return or repair the device if issues arise.", "Can you suggest a place?", "There are several places where you can buy a refurbished iPhone. There's Decluttr, a site offering a 12-month limited warranty, a 14-day money-back guarantee, and a thorough 70-step testing process on the iPhones they sell. They offer iPhones from the 5S to the XS, starting at $84.99. Then there's Best Buy, where the customer can get a Geek Squad-certified refurbished iPhone. They offer financing plans, and the availability of refurbished iPhones can be checked on their app or website. iPhones 8 starting at $299.99, can be purchased there. Finally, there's Apple, which offers many benefits, such as iPhones in the original white box with all peripherals, genuine Apple parts, a one-year warranty, and AppleCare for an extended warranty.

Squats are also considered a functional exercise that mimics movements used in daily life, such as sitting down, picking up objects, or leaning down. On the other hand, the deadlift is a movement where you hinge your hips backward to lower down and pick up a weighted barbell or kettlebell from the floor.", "And which muscles does each target?", "Squats primarily target the glutes and quads whereas deadlifts target muscles such as the upper and lower back, glutes, and hamstrings.

{"sample_id": "18-1_15", "context": ["What are some different workout routines I can try?", "There are many different workout routines you can try to build muscle.

HIIT stands for high-intensity interval training. It is a form of interval training that involves alternating short periods of intense exercise at maximum effort with periods of less intense exercise. During HIIT workouts, individuals engage in brief bursts of high-intensity exercises, such as sprinting or performing challenging exercises, followed by short recovery periods of lower-intensity exercises or rest. This pattern of alternating between high-intensity and low-intensity intervals is repeated for the duration of the workout.", "And how does it help?", "High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) has been scientifically proven to aid in muscle building. Studies have demonstrated that 3-6 weeks of HIIT can lead to increased muscle size and strength, particularly in beginners. For instance, overweight men and women who engaged in a 3-week lower-body HIIT program experienced significant growth in leg muscles compared to a control group. Similar results have been observed in other studies, indicating that HIIT is as effective as traditional weight training for promoting muscle gains. One of the factors contributing to the muscle-building benefits of HIIT is the increased production of testosterone, a hormone that aids in muscle synthesis. HIIT has been shown to elevate testosterone levels, especially in men. However, it's important to note that HIIT alone is not sufficient for muscle growth. Proper nutrition, including adequate protein intake, is crucial. Consuming around 1.2 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day supports muscle development. Incorporating weights into HIIT workouts, known as weighted HIIT, can further enhance muscle-building effects. Weighted HIIT, involving the use of dumbbells or kettlebells, has been proven to increase muscle size and strength, similar to traditional weight training. This hybrid workout combines the fat-burning benefits of HIIT with the muscle-building effects, providing a comprehensive approach. Additionally, the EPOC effect associated with HIIT, specifically intense interval training, contributes to fat loss and helps in achieving muscle definition.", "Can you compare it to strength training?", "HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) and strength training are two different types of exercises that focus on different systems in the body. Strength training primarily targets the muscles, while HIIT mainly targets the heart rate. However, this doesn't mean that HIIT and strength training cannot be combined or compared. While HIIT and strength training can be merged to some extent, it is generally recommended to work on them separately more often than together in order to target each aspect effectively. HIIT is known for its ability to elevate the heart rate quickly through short bursts of intense activity followed by brief resting periods. On the other hand, strength training involves lifting weights and focusing on muscle development.", "So they can be combined? How is that?", "To incorporate HIIT into a strength training routine, one approach is to shorten the rest periods between weight lifting sets. By reducing the amount of rest time, the heart rate remains elevated, providing a cardiovascular benefit alongside the muscle-building aspect of strength training. Additionally, you can turn the rest periods into cardio sets by performing cardio exercises such as jump rope, jumping jacks, or burpees between weight lifting sets.

Other questions may explore the candidate's ability to convince a client to transition to Google's cloud solutions, their opinion on charging Gmail users or for Google's productivity apps, and their views on the future of digital marketing. These questions help assess the candidate's critical thinking, problem-solving skills, knowledge of the industry, and alignment with Google's values and goals. It is essential for candidates to prepare thoughtful and well-reasoned responses to showcase their abilities and demonstrate their fit for the role and the company. Does this help?", "Yes, this is very helpful, thank you! How can I do well on this round?", "To excel in this round, the following tips may be helpful: First, familiarize yourself with Google's values and culture. Align your personality and career aspirations with the company's mission. Second, prepare for situational questions using the STAR method. Structure your responses by providing context, describing tasks, explaining actions taken, and highlighting positive results. Third, showcase your knowledge of Google products, including their features, competitive advantages, and areas for improvement. Articulate your ideas clearly and logically. Fourth, highlight your accomplishments and problem-solving skills. Discuss projects you're proud of, the challenges you faced, your problem-solving approach, and the positive results achieved. For example, you may talk about your research experience during your undergrad. Your research experience can demonstrate your ability to work independently, think critically, and solve complex problems. It can also showcase your ability to learn new skills and adapt to new situations. These are all valuable skills in a software engineering role. Fifth, demonstrate strong interpersonal skills. Emphasize your communication, problem-solving, creativity, leadership, and teamwork abilities. Again, here you may draw on your research experience. Share examples of conflict resolution within teams. By following these tips, you can position yourself for success in this round and impress the interviewers at Google.", "Can you tell me more about the STAR method? How should I use it?", "The STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) is a structured approach to answering interview questions using specific examples. It helps provide a clear and comprehensive response to behavioral questions. Look for questions that prompt you to share specific situations or examples from your past experiences. Use the STAR method to structure your answers. Begin by describing the situation or context of the example, including any challenges or obstacles. Then, explain the tasks or responsibilities you had in that situation. Focus on what you were responsible for or what the goal was. Next, discuss the actions you took to address the situation or achieve the goal. Provide specific examples and highlight your problem-solving skills. Finally, share the results and outcomes of your actions. Explain how your efforts contributed to achieving the desired results and any lessons learned from the experience. As an extroverted person, emphasize experiences where you've led teams, collaborated in group projects, and effectively solved problems through teamwork. Show enthusiasm for working with diverse teams at Google during the interview. By using the STAR method, you can effectively showcase your skills and experiences in a structured and compelling manner.", "Okay, that makes sense. I've worked on a lot of team projects and led a few too. But what if they ask me about any weaknesses or areas I need to improve on?", "It's important to be honest about areas for improvement. The goal isn't to present yourself as perfect but as a learner and a grower. Choose a real weakness, but one that you're working to improve. Show them you're proactive about growth. For example, you're working on becoming more comfortable with public speaking. This shows self-awareness, honesty, and a willingness to learn and grow. By acknowledging your weakness (public speaking) and discussing the steps you are taking to improve, you demonstrate that you are proactive and committed to personal and professional development. This can be seen as a positive trait by the interviewer. To summarize, the key to talking about your weaknesses is to pair self-awareness with an action and a result: What's the weakness? What have you been doing to improve? How has that improvement had a positive impact on your work?", "Thanks! Now, I'm wondering about what to wear for the interview. I know Google has a casual dress code, but I want to make a good first impression.", "That's a great question. While it's true that Google has a casual dress code, for an interview it's better to err on the side of formal. A good rule of thumb is to dress one level up from what employees typically wear. So, in this case, business casual should be a safe choice. You could go with dress pants and a nice shirt, for instance. How does that sound to you?", "That sounds reasonable. I'll stick to business casual then. Now, how should I handle a situation if I don't know the answer to a question?", "It's perfectly normal not to know the answer to every question. Not knowing the best way to respond to a question is not likely to eliminate you from consideration for a job. Recognize that other interviewees may also struggle with answering questions, and a solid but imperfect interview is often sufficient to move forward in the screening process. Maintaining a calm and confident posture when confronted with a tough question is crucial. Avoid panicking and remember that interviewers understand that nerves can affect performance. You can ask for additional time to consider the question or to clarify it if you didn't understand. It is better to admit that you don't know the answer than to make something up. If you are genuinely perplexed by a question, politely and briefly state that you are not sure. You can then spin it into a more positive response by mentioning that you will think about the question after the interview, do some research, or express your willingness to learn more about the topic if hired. If a key question stumps you, you can research and develop a strong answer after the interview. Including that answer in your follow-up communication shows your persistence, resourcefulness, and willingness to go the extra mile.", "I think that's a sensible approach. It shows honesty. Now, what if I give an incorrect answer during the technical round?", "In general, it's fine to make mistakes and take the wrong approach now and again, as long as you respond positively and are open to feedback. It's important not to get too nervous or let your mistakes affect your confidence. Interviewers are not only assessing your technical abilities but also evaluating your problem-solving approach, attitude, and how well you can handle pressure. Regardless of the outcome, it's always beneficial to ask for feedback after the interview. You can inquire about areas where you may have made mistakes or seek clarification on questions that you struggled with. This shows your willingness to learn and improve. Remember that making a mistake or giving an incorrect answer in a technical interview does not necessarily mean automatic rejection.

(2) On-site Interview: This stage consists of 3-5 rounds of coding and other technical skill assessments. Google tests extensively for problem-solving skills during these rounds. The questions asked center around a candidate's proficiency in core technical areas such as data structures, coding, algorithms, and systems design. (3) Behavioral Interview: This round assesses the candidate's interpersonal skills, teamwork, work-life balance, adaptability, and knowledge about Google's products and the company.

I'll stick to business casual then. Now, how should I handle a situation if I don't know the answer to a question?", "It's perfectly normal not to know the answer to every question. Not knowing the best way to respond to a question is not likely to eliminate you from consideration for a job. Recognize that other interviewees may also struggle with answering questions, and a solid but imperfect interview is often sufficient to move forward in the screening process. Maintaining a calm and confident posture when confronted with a tough question is crucial. Avoid panicking and remember that interviewers understand that nerves can affect performance. You can ask for additional time to consider the question or to clarify it if you didn't understand. It is better to admit that you don't know the answer than to make something up. If you are genuinely perplexed by a question, politely and briefly state that you are not sure. You can then spin it into a more positive response by mentioning that you will think about the question after the interview, do some research, or express your willingness to learn more about the topic if hired. If a key question stumps you, you can research and develop a strong answer after the interview. Including that answer in your follow-up communication shows your persistence, resourcefulness, and willingness to go the extra mile.", "I think that's a sensible approach. It shows honesty. Now, what if I give an incorrect answer during the technical round?", "In general, it's fine to make mistakes and take the wrong approach now and again, as long as you respond positively and are open to feedback. It's important not to get too nervous or let your mistakes affect your confidence. Interviewers are not only assessing your technical abilities but also evaluating your problem-solving approach, attitude, and how well you can handle pressure. Regardless of the outcome, it's always beneficial to ask for feedback after the interview. You can inquire about areas where you may have made mistakes or seek clarification on questions that you struggled with. This shows your willingness to learn and improve. Remember that making a mistake or giving an incorrect answer in a technical interview does not necessarily mean automatic rejection. Interviewers consider various factors, including problem-solving skills, attitude, communication, and cultural fit. It's important to stay positive, learn from any mistakes, and use the experience as an opportunity for growth.", "That's really helpful. How do I follow up after the interview?", "After the interview, it's always a good idea to send a thank-you note to your interviewer. This not only shows your appreciation for their time but also reinforces your interest in the role. It can be a simple email, expressing gratitude and briefly highlighting your excitement about the opportunity. Additionally, it's crucial to be patient while waiting for a response, as the decision-making process can sometimes take a while.", "That's excellent advice. I'll definitely send a thank-you note after the interview. What if I haven't heard back in a week?", "The Google interviewing process can be time-consuming, and delays are common. After interviews, interviewers need time to write up their notes, which can take up to 24 hours. The recruiter then reviews the interview report to determine if an on-site interview is warranted. This process may take several days, especially when multiple candidates are being considered. It is advisable not to rush with follow-up emails and to wait at least two weeks before sending another one. Remember that the recruiting process involves many candidates, and constant communication may not expedite it. If you haven't heard back after two weeks, it's acceptable to contact the recruiter and the sourcer you worked with. The recruiter should have been in touch within 48 hours of your interviews. However, delays can occur as the hiring process involves multiple stages and discussions within the hiring committee. If the recruiter provides feedback and wants to chat, it could be a positive sign, but it's important not to assume anything until you have a conversation. Speculating won't be productive, so focus on other tasks until you have that phone call. Patience is crucial throughout the process.", "Can I crack it in just 1 month of preparation?", "Have you done any coding before? Or taken a computer science course?", "I had a data structures course once back in undergrad. We learned the basics of C programming. So I know some basic coding and data structures.", "Cracking the Google interview in one month with only basic knowledge of C and data structures may be possible for some individuals, but it would require intensive, full-time study, and a strong grasp of computer science fundamentals, and algorithms. You could focus on mastering the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms, and practice solving coding problems on websites such as LeetCode or GeeksforGeeks. You could also go through books such as \"Cracking the Coding Interview\" to prepare for the interview", "That's excellent advice. Can you compare the two websites? Which one would be more suitable for me?", "According to some references, Leetcode is considered the best site for interview preparation, while GeeksForGeeks is more focused on theory and competitive programming. Leetcode has a comprehensive list of questions, good editorials, strong test cases, and a vibrant community. GeeksForGeeks has good theory content but is sometimes coded inefficiently, and their practice platform has weak test cases. In terms of community engagement and discussion, Leetcode is praised for its active and helpful community. For beginners, both sites offer a starting point with a list of top questions. Leetcode suggests starting with the \"Top 100 Liked Questions\" and \"Top Interview Questions\", sorted by difficulty level (easy, medium, hard). GeeksForGeeks also provides a collection of questions, but its list may be limited compared to Leetcode.", "Thanks! Now, would it be a bad idea to reschedule an interview?", "It would not be a bad idea to reschedule an interview for a software engineering position at Google. The general consensus among former Google employees and others who have gone through the interview process is that Google's interviewers understand that life happens and that candidates may need to reschedule for various reasons. Google probably won't ask for a reason, but it's good to give a few days heads-up so the interviewer can adjust their schedule accordingly. May I ask, if you would reschedule the interview, would that be because you feel unprepared?"], "current_query": "Yes, I do feel unprepared and hence thinking about rescheduling.

This is my first interview and I could really use some advice.", "Sure, I'd be happy to help you prepare for your upcoming interview at Google. What position are you interviewing for at Google?", "Thanks! I am interviewing for the position of software engineer.", "That's amazing! There are a few things you can do to prepare for your interview at Google. Here are some tips: (1) Re-read your resume and the job description to help you draw connections between the two. (2) Include data when highlighting your achievements during the interview. This helps your interviewer understand the impact you made. For example, you can refer to one of your research projects during your undergrad and point out how your work helped to advance the field. (3) Prepare examples of times you achieved something. Many of the questions asked will be along the lines of \"Tell me about a time when...\" or \"How would you approach this situation...?\" (4) Come to the interview with your own questions. This shows that you care about understanding Google and the position you're applying for. (5) If you're doing a virtual interview, take some time to prepare your space. Find a quiet area with good internet connection where you won't be disturbed. Check your mic, video, and Wi-Fi to make sure everything is in working order.", "Thanks for those amazing tips! I will try to incorporate them. Now, can you give me an overview of what the process might look like?", "Sure! Based on some references, the interview process at Google may involve several rounds such as: (1) Technical Phone Screen Interview: This initial interview screens candidates based on their proficiency in a programming language and their ability to solve simple coding problems by using programming fundamentals. (2) On-site Interview: This stage consists of 3-5 rounds of coding and other technical skill assessments. Google tests extensively for problem-solving skills during these rounds. The questions asked center around a candidate's proficiency in core technical areas such as data structures, coding, algorithms, and systems design. (3) Behavioral Interview: This round assesses the candidate's interpersonal skills, teamwork, work-life balance, adaptability, and knowledge about Google's products and the company. After these rounds, an offer is given based on the candidate's performance as assessed in each individual round of the interview process. The candidates are tested on a range of topics, including domain-specific questions depending on the role they are applying for (such as software developer, AI, and machine learning, front-end development, back-end development, or engineering management).", "Hmm, the process sounds quite tedious. I am curious about the behavioral round. Can you tell me more about it?", "The behavioral round in a Google interview is a crucial evaluation of a candidate's soft skills, interpersonal traits, and fit with the company's culture. It is particularly significant for senior-level software engineer positions. This round aims to assess not only the candidate's technical abilities but also their personal attributes. Various types of questions are asked to examine different aspects of the candidate's professional and personal qualities. Examples of such questions include inquiring about the candidate's motivation to work at Google, how they would improve a Google product, their knowledge of Google's competitors, and their understanding of Google's history. Other questions may explore the candidate's ability to convince a client to transition to Google's cloud solutions, their opinion on charging Gmail users or for Google's productivity apps, and their views on the future of digital marketing. These questions help assess the candidate's critical thinking, problem-solving skills, knowledge of the industry, and alignment with Google's values and goals. It is essential for candidates to prepare thoughtful and well-reasoned responses to showcase their abilities and demonstrate their fit for the role and the company. Does this help?", "Yes, this is very helpful, thank you! How can I do well on this round?", "To excel in this round, the following tips may be helpful: First, familiarize yourself with Google's values and culture. Align your personality and career aspirations with the company's mission. Second, prepare for situational questions using the STAR method. Structure your responses by providing context, describing tasks, explaining actions taken, and highlighting positive results. Third, showcase your knowledge of Google products, including their features, competitive advantages, and areas for improvement. Articulate your ideas clearly and logically. Fourth, highlight your accomplishments and problem-solving skills. Discuss projects you're proud of, the challenges you faced, your problem-solving approach, and the positive results achieved. For example, you may talk about your research experience during your undergrad. Your research experience can demonstrate your ability to work independently, think critically, and solve complex problems. It can also showcase your ability to learn new skills and adapt to new situations. These are all valuable skills in a software engineering role. Fifth, demonstrate strong interpersonal skills. Emphasize your communication, problem-solving, creativity, leadership, and teamwork abilities. Again, here you may draw on your research experience. Share examples of conflict resolution within teams. By following these tips, you can position yourself for success in this round and impress the interviewers at Google.", "Can you tell me more about the STAR method? How should I use it?", "The STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) is a structured approach to answering interview questions using specific examples. It helps provide a clear and comprehensive response to behavioral questions. Look for questions that prompt you to share specific situations or examples from your past experiences. Use the STAR method to structure your answers. Begin by describing the situation or context of the example, including any challenges or obstacles. Then, explain the tasks or responsibilities you had in that situation. Focus on what you were responsible for or what the goal was. Next, discuss the actions you took to address the situation or achieve the goal. Provide specific examples and highlight your problem-solving skills. Finally, share the results and outcomes of your actions. Explain how your efforts contributed to achieving the desired results and any lessons learned from the experience. As an extroverted person, emphasize experiences where you've led teams, collaborated in group projects, and effectively solved problems through teamwork. Show enthusiasm for working with diverse teams at Google during the interview. By using the STAR method, you can effectively showcase your skills and experiences in a structured and compelling manner.", "Okay, that makes sense. I've worked on a lot of team projects and led a few too. But what if they ask me about any weaknesses or areas I need to improve on?", "It's important to be honest about areas for improvement. The goal isn't to present yourself as perfect but as a learner and a grower. Choose a real weakness, but one that you're working to improve. Show them you're proactive about growth. For example, you're working on becoming more comfortable with public speaking. This shows self-awareness, honesty, and a willingness to learn and grow. By acknowledging your weakness (public speaking) and discussing the steps you are taking to improve, you demonstrate that you are proactive and committed to personal and professional development. This can be seen as a positive trait by the interviewer. To summarize, the key to talking about your weaknesses is to pair self-awareness with an action and a result: What's the weakness? What have you been doing to improve? How has that improvement had a positive impact on your work?", "Thanks! Now, I'm wondering about what to wear for the interview.

Histamine is a chemical that: 1) communicates messages to your brain, 2) triggers the release of stomach acid to help with digestion, and 3) is released after injury or allergic reaction as part of your body's immune response. When histamine levels get too high or when it can't break down properly, it can affect your normal bodily functions. The symptoms can affect different parts of the body but gastrointestinal symptoms such as the bloating, you mentioned, are the most common. In order to relieve your symptoms you should begin by limiting the intake of foods that are rich in histamine. Some foods contain high levels of histamines while others produce histamine.

Histamine intolerance itself is caused by an imbalance between histamine release and the body's ability to metabolize it.

Quick cooking methods like pressure cooking can significantly reduce histamine levels. It's important to note that freezing can prevent histamine levels from increasing, but during the thawing process, histamine levels can rise. Therefore, consuming foods as fresh as possible and cooking them using quick and appropriate methods can help minimize histamine levels.", "Thanks for the explanation. Are there any specific tests to diagnose histamine intolerance?", "Yes, there are a few ways to diagnose histamine intolerance. One method involves measuring the level of diamine oxidase (DAO) in your blood, as low levels of DAO can indicate histamine intolerance. Another method is a skin prick test, where a small amount of histamine is inserted under your skin to see if a reaction occurs. It's also common to do an elimination diet, where you avoid high histamine foods and gradually reintroduce them to see if symptoms reoccur. However, these tests are not perfect and may not always provide a clear diagnosis, so it's important to work closely with your healthcare provider to understand your symptoms and manage your condition."], "current_query": "Thanks for all the information.

{"sample_id": "21-1_10", "context": ["Yesterday I showed the movie Contagion in my class and we had a very long discussion. The students were mesmerized by a movie that preceded the recent pandemic by nearly a decade. It was quite an emotional experience for all of us. Later I noticed a chyron on the TV screen at home that read: WHO chief: the world must be ready for the next pandemic. What was this about?", "The director general of the World Health Organization while addressing the seventy-sixth World Health Assembly-the organization's decision-making body, which was held last month in Geneva-said that although COVID-19 may no longer be a global public emergency, countries must still strengthen the response to the disease and prepare for future pandemics and other threats.", "Strengthening how?", "According to my sources, it means that countries should work to achieve a well-functioning health system. They employ trained and motivated health workers, a well-maintained infrastructure, and a reliable supply of medicines and technologies, backed by adequate funding, strong health plans, and evidence-based policies. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that countries should accelerate equitable access to and delivery of safe vaccinations for COVID-19 into their health system while minimizing disruption to other essential health services. They should strengthen health systems to facilitate prevention, detection, and response to COVID-19 through widespread equitable access to diagnostics and therapeutics, and integrate COVID-19 management into their country's health systems.", "As if the world is an equal playing field, what about the poor?", "This is an excellent question that was elucidated in an article published in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences journal fifteen years ago. The authors of the article looked at different approaches to improve health care since people in poor countries tend to have less access to health services than those in better-off countries, and within countries, the poor have less access to health services. They found new innovations in financing, delivery, and regulation of health services that hold promise for improving access to the poor, such as the use of health equity funds, conditional cash transfers, and co-production and regulation of health services. In 2020 the US CDC outlined in its global response strategy the need to strengthen the global health security architecture. They have global programs in place that are run by world experts in epidemiology, surveillance, informatics, laboratory systems, and other essential disciplines and provide strong global health leadership capacity. The work of these experts strengthens critical public health services around the world. I hope that answers your question. Are you still interested in the next possible pandemic?", "You betcha.", "There are multiple virus families known to infect humans; the pandemic events since 1900, have been linked to either influenza or coronavirus families. According to WHO the next flu pandemic is a statistical certainty, but the time and severity cannot be predicted. Climate change and further encroachment of humans into animal habitats mean these viruses are coming closer to human populations. SARS-CoV-2 is everywhere and humans are seeding new transmission back into other species.", "I was afraid of that. Aside from what seems to me like empty promises, what really can be done?", "A group of highly experienced public health officials and world-renowned experts participated in a special stimulated exercise, meant to play out what might happen if the world was presented with a new disease-called disease X-spreading quickly, with no warning. The exercise concluded with a few lessons learned from COVID. 1. Vaccines have to reach arms much faster. 2. It has to be much easier to develop and distribute tests. 3. A stronger stockpile of high-quality protective gear is crucial. 4. The approach to indoor air quality has to be seriously changed. 5.
