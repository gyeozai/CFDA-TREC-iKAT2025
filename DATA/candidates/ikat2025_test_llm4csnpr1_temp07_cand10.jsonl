Does it have a reason?", "Acid reflux is a condition that occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter (LES)--a muscle between the stomach and esophagus-- malfunctions, allowing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus. This can cause a burning sensation in your heart and chest, which we often refer to as \"heartburn.\" Over time, prolonged acid reflux can cause damage to the esophagus and potentially lead to the chronic form of the condition called GERD. Acid reflux happens due to improper functioning of the LES. Acid reflux normally happens when we eat certain foods that stimulate excess acid production; however, for some people, genetics plays a role in reflux. Eating large meals, lying down straight after eating, or snacking close to bedtime are also common triggers of reflux. Being overweight means that you are more likely to suffer from reflux because of increased pressure on your stomach, which can force open the valve after a meal. Some people find that acid reflux is worse when they are stressed. Acid reflux also happens due to a weakness of the sphincter muscle, or when the stomach produces too much acid and not enough protective mucus. There is also something called a hiatus hernia; due to a gap in the diaphragm, parts of the stomach can move into the chest, which increases the risk of reflux.", "I have a deadline approaching.

Since taping restricts finger movement, it prevents you from using the injured area in ways that could make the damage worse, making it a generally safe and recommended approach. According to Dave Saunders, a physiotherapist and climbing injury specialist known for his work on hand and finger injuries in climbers, effective taping for A2 and A3 pulley injuries should limit the finger's ability to bend at the middle joint. To apply the tape correctly, note the three creases on the front of your finger, starting from the base. With your finger straight, begin taping from halfway between the first and second crease and finish halfway between the second and third, overlapping the tape by 50%. Once taped, you'll notice you can't crimp anymore, which is actually a good thing for healing.

Whether it's problematic depends on a few factors, including the intensity of the pain and the location. Can you tell me where exactly the pain is located? Is it in the pulley, the joint, or the tendon? I can also provide you with a detailed anatomy of the finger if you cannot localize it yourself.", "Yes please, I don't really know, it could be the tendon.", "That's totally fair, it can be hard to tell, so let's break down the anatomy of the finger. Three bones and three hinged joints make up the finger. Ligaments connect and stabilize the bones, while tendons connect muscle to bone, transferring to the bone any forces created by the muscles. Flexor tendons in the fingers attach to muscles in the forearms that pull on the tendons, bend the fingers, and allow us to crimp. Connective tissue encases the tendons, forming a sheath with five thickened areas that create the annular pulleys (A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5), which keep the tendon close to the bone when bending the fingers.", "Thanks, but please relate your answer to my pain? How is the pain on those different areas?", "Yes sure. Most common climbing injuries actually come from pulley, sometimes with a loud \"pop\" and then significant swelling and pain. For A2 pulley injuries, the most common pulley injury for climbers, the pain usually arises at the base of the finger and is noticeable when trying to straighten or bend the finger. For A2-A4 ruptures, there may be bowstringing, bulging at the base of the finger, which can be detected by resisting finger bending at the fingertip. Those are usually associated with pain on the front of the finger. Otherwise, if you see difficulties with bending your finger, this can be due to damage on the tendon, it can be the case if you also have an open injury or a cut on the open side of your hand. Finally, if you feel that the pain is more on the side of the finger, then this might be the collateral ligaments of the fingers.", "I have pain in the front of the finger, especially when crimping, but I cannot see any bowstring, can this still be the A2 pulley?", "When you bend your finger, normally the tendon stays snug against the bone because the pulleys hold it down. In very serious cases, if you have a complete rupture of the pulley (especially A2), the tendon lifts off the bone, forming a visible or palpable \"bowstring\" under the skin. However, you can also have just a strain on the A2 pulley, with pain when crimping, which is less serious than the complete rupture, but still needs some rest. It is a good sign if you don't have a visible bowstring.", "I understand, what are the next steps?", "If you have pain in your A2 pulley as a climber, here is what to do next, depending on the severity of the injury: Grade 1: Pulley sprain. A partial tear of a single pulley. Solution: No need for immobilization. Begin gentle range-of-motion exercises, bend the finger until it feels tight, hold for 2-3 seconds, relax, and repeat 10 times for several sessions each day. Now perform the same exercise, only straighten the finger. Avoid pushing through pain. Grade 2: Complete A4 or partial A2, A3 tear/rupture. Either the A4 pulley is completely torn, or A2 and A3 are both partially torn. Solution: One to two weeks of immobilization with a finger-immobilization splint or a pulley-protection splint. Gentle range-of-motion exercises. If it persists, you can seek a diagnosis from a climbing-knowledgeable physician or orthopaedic surgeon, who can assess the damage with an ultrasound or MRI. This will help determine the level of care needed, as well as confirm and check possible damage to the rest of your hand.", "I don't think I want to do an MRI. Anyway, what are the risks if I don't rest?", "You risk damaging the pulley even more, which can be very dangerous and lead to surgery. From past patients that went through the surgery, most of them complained of reduced finger dexterity while performing their daily activities and work, and not being able to perform as they use to at climbing. This is not advisable. Even without going as far as the surgery, it can lead to a worsening of the tear, a bowstring, over-compensation from another part of your hand and risk of further injuries. Your body might also do inadequate healing with excessive scar tissue and limit your flexibility in the future.", "I will take it slow and take a few weeks off. What are some advice for when I start again?", "That's a good spirit. It is advised to spend the first weeks climbing relatively easy routes with big holds, good footholds and keeping sessions short. Stay away from overhangs and campus boards. You can return to full-force climbing if easy climbing yields no pain. Continue taping (it will also serve as a mental note of the previous injury) and avoid tweaky crimps and pockets for several months. Collagen supplements may also help the pulley recover faster by providing much needed building block nutrients. It is also good to re-start in indoor climbing rather than outdoor directly, as low temperatures increase the risk of injury.", "I don't like taking supplements. How to tape?", "Yes, it is totally understandable, many people prefer not to take supplements. When it comes to taping, it can be a helpful way to protect an injured pulley. Since taping restricts finger movement, it prevents you from using the injured area in ways that could make the damage worse, making it a generally safe and recommended approach. According to Dave Saunders, a physiotherapist and climbing injury specialist known for his work on hand and finger injuries in climbers, effective taping for A2 and A3 pulley injuries should limit the finger's ability to bend at the middle joint. To apply the tape correctly, note the three creases on the front of your finger, starting from the base. With your finger straight, begin taping from halfway between the first and second crease and finish halfway between the second and third, overlapping the tape by 50%. Once taped, you'll notice you can't crimp anymore, which is actually a good thing for healing. The goal is to restrict the range of motion at the injured joint so that crimping becomes impossible, protecting the pulley during recovery.", "What about the H shape?", "H-taping is generally more effective than standard circumferential taping for supporting injured finger pulleys, especially the A2 and A3. To apply an H-tape correctly, start with a piece of athletic tape about 4 inches long and the full width of the roll. From each end, tear lengthwise inward, stopping about half an inch before reaching the centre, so you are left with a narrow \"bridge\" between two tails. This creates the \"H\" shape. Place the central bridge of the tape over the palmar side (the inner surface) of the middle joint of the injured finger. Start by wrapping the two tails around the section of the finger closer to the palm (proximal phalanx), anchoring it firmly. Then, slightly bend the finger, about 30 degrees at the joint, and wrap the other two tails around the section of the finger beyond the joint (middle phalanx). This technique limits extension and flexion at the joint, providing mechanical support to reduce stress on the injured pulley while still allowing controlled movement for rehab."], "current_query": "Should I tape other fingers as well when training?", "predicted_rewrite": ["Should I tape my other fingers as well while training with an injured finger?", "Should I tape other fingers as well when training, even if they are not injured?", "Should I tape my other fingers as well when training for climbing?", "Should I tape my other fingers as well while training after my injury?", "Should I tape my other fingers as well when training to prevent injuries?", "Should I tape my other fingers as well when training to prevent injuries?", "Should I tape other fingers as well when training to prevent injury or support my climbing performance?", "Should I tape my other fingers as well when training, even if they are not injured?", "Should I tape my other fingers as well when I am training for climbing?", "Should I tape my other fingers as well when training, even if they are not injured?"], "predicted_response": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}

{"sample_id": "3-2_10", "context": ["Hey, I've been feeling blue for the last few weeks, I have no energy. Can you help me?", "You used to be very active with climbing, and since physical activity releases endorphins, stopping might explain your low motivation, that would make total sense. Staying active is especially important when you have a desk job. You might consider spending your free time doing things you enjoy, like visiting art museums or gradually easing back into gentle physical activity. Would you like to try another sport while your finger heals?", "Yes please, can you help me figure out some options?", "That's a really smart move during recovery. You could consider biking. It can make you feel good with the secretion of endorphins! It is also possible to do it indoor and outdoor like climbing, when the weather allows it. There are lots of great cycling routes close to London. From Richmond Park to Hampstead Heath, it's easy to get out and find yourself in wild nature.", "I tried biking in the past, but it bored me.", "Biking can feel monotonous, especially if you're riding the same routes or doing it solo. You could consider changing the route, the terrain, listening to music, or joining a group to go with friends. Do you want suggestions for biking routes, or inspiring resources about cycling?", "No, I rather want to change from biking.", "You could consider swimming, rowing, yoga, pilates, or dance cardio. All are fun activities that also require balance and cardio, without putting too much pressure on the finger. Otherwise, you could do some strength workouts with lower body resistance bands, core work or body weight exercises. Generally swimming is good for recovery, as it doesn't put too much pressure on the joints, and yoga is also a very good sport to combine with climbing, you could increase your flexibility while recovering your finger.", "But I have heard cold water is not good for recovery.", "It's true that cold water can slow circulation through vasoconstriction, which isn't ideal in the early stages of recovery, especially within the first few days of an A2 pulley injury. However, swimming is not necessarily a bad sport during recovery, as long as you are past the acute phase and take precautions. After a couple of weeks, gentle swimming can actually support circulation and mobility without putting too much strain on the finger. Just make sure to protect your hand; using gloves can help keep it warm and prevent further stress. As always, listen to your body and avoid any strokes or movements that cause discomfort.", "I think I will combine yoga with swimming; do you know of any water spot nearby?", "Yoga and swimming make a great combination for both fitness and recovery. If you're near London, there are several good options for outdoor swimming. In the north, you can check out the West Reservoir Centre in Hackney. If you're based in the south, Beckenham Place Park in Lewisham features a Georgian lake that's been transformed into a popular swimming spot in recent years.", "What budget should I consider for this activity?", "Swimming can be a very cheap sport. Now, for wild swim in cold water, better protect yourself against the cold. It would be around 160 pounds if you take a full swimming kit. This would include gloves, swimming suit, goggles, and the hair protection. You can also consider buying a smartwatch to record your session, would this interest you?", "And for yoga?", "For yoga, the initial costs are generally low since you don't need much equipment, just comfortable clothing and, optionally, a yoga mat (most studios provide them). The main expense comes from how you choose to participate: drop-in classes typically cost EUR15-25 each; monthly memberships range from $55 to $150 USD for standard studios, and up to $500 USD for premium unlimited access. If you're interested in a deeper experience, yoga retreats or seminars, including accommodation and meals, usually cost between EUR800 and EUR1,200 for 5 to 7 nights. Overall, you can budget around EUR80-EUR150 per month for regular practice. Would you like more details for one of the options?", "I would rather do it at home, any other solution?", "Yes sure, you can use an app on your phone, with descriptions of poses, and hundreds of videos to help you with yoga and meditation, for example, Yoga.com or daily Yoga.

I think that the American Museum of Natural History and The New York Historical could be especially interesting for you. In addition, here is a list of other museums you would like to consider: The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), The Memorial Art Gallery, The Museum of the City of New York, The Skyscraper Museum, The International Center of Photography, and The Museum of the Moving Image.", "I also heard about one on the subway, New York subway is the oldest one in the world?", "Yes, there is a museum about New York's subways, called the New York Transit Museum. Museums Special interest Boerum Hill New York Transit Museum recounts subway history with a vintage fleet of restored cars that let visitors climb aboard to imagine themselves as straphangers from different decades dating back to the subway opening in 1904. However, the world's first subway was London's Metropolitan Railway that opened in 1863 with steam powered trains.", "Why is the subway so important for the city then?", "It was the arrival of the subway that transformed a seedy neighborhood called Longacre Square into Times Square, that helped turn a single square mile surrounding the Wall Street station into the center of global finance, that made Coney Island an amusement park for the masses. It was the subway that fuelled the astonishing economic growth that built the city's iconic skyscrapers. Other cities had subways, but none threaded through nearly as many neighborhoods as New York's, enabling it to move large numbers of workers between Manhattan and the middle-class boroughs -- a cycle that repeated itself every day, generating ever more wealth and drawing in ever more people. As New York evolved over the decades, the subway was the one constant, the very thing that made it possible to repurpose 19th-century factories and warehouses as offices or condominiums, or to reimagine a two-mile spit of land between Manhattan and Queens that once housed a smallpox hospital as a high-tech university hub.", "Is it the largest in the world?", "The subway in New York City is the largest subway systems in the world in terms of track mileage and number of stops (472), and one of the only 24 hour subway systems in the world. In comparison, the second place is the one from Shanghai with 345 stations. However, it is not the busiest one, as the one from Beijing had a record of 13 million passengers in a day.", "What was the first line?", "The first portion, from City Hall north to 42nd Street, was opened between 1904 and 1908, and is part of the first subway line in the city.", "Thanks, I understand. By the way, is there a place in NY that would be good to see for me, closer to my culture?", "Spanish is the lingua franca among immigrants from Latin America and dominates conversation in neighborhoods like East Harlem; Corona, Queens; and Hunts Point, in the Bronx. There is a neighborhood in Manhattan that some of its old timers call \"Espana Chica\" - Little Spain. From the late 19th century to the present time, it served as the social and cultural nerve center of Spanish immigrants who settled in New York City. Little Spain sits just above the West Village, mostly along West 14th Street, but the casual non-Spanish pedestrian would hardly know they were in a Spanish ethnic enclave. If this stroller were a vexillologist (or a fan of the Real Madrid Soccer team) she would no doubt know that the flag hanging in front of the nondescript brownstone at 239 West 14th Street, home of the Spanish Benevolent Society, was that of Spain. You can also go to restaurant, you have some great Spaniard restaurant in New York, in Manhattan, also some romantic restaurant, also in the Bronx, and Soho.", "I also want to take some time to relax after the race.", "How's your preparation for the race going? Once it's all done, it definitely makes sense to take some time to relax, here are some options: 1. Central Park is the most popular park in New York, but there are plenty of hidden spots that aren't as swarmed with tourism. One of these in-the-know hangouts is Sheep Meadow, a 15-acre preserve in the western part of the Park between 66th to 69th Streets. 2. Tudor City Overpass (42nd St - map it): Go as far east as you can on 42nd Street in Manhattan, and you'll land on a quiet, scenic refuge just steps from the busiest part of town. Tudor City Overpass is great for snapping that perfectly symmetrical landscape photo overlooking the city (especially during Manhattanhenge), and there are two landmark parks and staircases flanking each side. You'll almost forget you're in Midtown. 3. AIRE Ancient Baths. AIRE has just eight luxurious spas worldwide, with one being in New York's Tribeca.

What specific foods or meals are you thinking about substituting?", "Well, let's start with breakfast.", "You can consider substituting jam with peanut butter because it is healthier for you than most jams and contains more protein and less sugar than jam. Instead of jam, you can use natural peanut butter or almond butter with banana, which is very healthy, or go for a sugar-free jam or apricot jam. Also, you can substitute it with honey, which is sweet and loaded with natural vitamins, antioxidants, enzymes, and other nutrients, and does not have any artificial sugar or sweeteners. Strawberry Chia Jam is also an easy, sweet 4-ingredient recipe that's the perfect alternative to regular jam. It's gluten-free, vegan, high in fiber, and low in sugar. Also, white bread is highly processed, high in the glycemic index, and contains unhealthy ingredients. Some substitutes are brown bread, whole wheat bread, oat bread, and multigrain bread. In addition, seeds such as poppy, chia, hemp, and sesame are high in calcium and easy to sprinkle onto breakfast food. Low-fat milk and other dairy products such as cheese and yoghurt are great sources of calcium, which can be used in the breakfast.", "Chia jam seems nice, I will give it a try, but I don't really like milk. How much calcium does chia jam have compared to milk?", "A 2-tablespoon serving of chia grape jam provides about 18-21 mg of calcium, depending on the recipe. The calcium comes primarily from chia seeds, which contain around 158 mg of calcium per 25 grams. In comparison, one cup of cow's milk typically offers 275-300 mg of calcium, covering roughly 30% of the recommended daily intake. Interestingly, lower-fat milk tends to have slightly more calcium, since milk fat itself doesn't contribute to calcium content.", "Thanks, and compared to others per 100g?", "The poppy seed has 1438 mg of calcium, hemp seed has 70mg of calcium, and chia seed has 631mg of calcium per 100 grams. Raw sesame seeds contain almost 1000 mg of calcium per 100 g serving. Tahini butter, a popular sesame seed-based nut butter, has 426 mg per 100 g serving. The amount of calcium in milk is 125 mg per 100g. The mozzarella non-fat cheese in 100g contains 961 mg of calcium.

Cauliflower rice is one of the best low-carb options, with very few calories and carbs, and it's quick to prepare. Quinoa is higher in protein and fiber than white rice and cooks in just 15 minutes, making it a nutritious, easy choice, though not as low in carbs. Black rice is naturally gluten-free and packed with antioxidants, even more than blueberries, with a slightly sweet, nutty flavor. Wild rice and brown rice also offer more protein and fiber than white rice, though they are not as low in carbs, making them better suited if you are focusing on nutrient density rather than strict carb reduction.

For sweeteners, stevia is a top choice, followed by xylitol, erythritol, and yacon syrup. Natural options like honey, molasses or maple syrup are better than white sugar but should still be used in moderation. Yogurt is another great substitute, using one cup of fat-free yogurt instead of oil can lighten the recipe, just be sure to adjust other liquids to avoid an overly wet batter.

Is it really bad to do it?", "No, breastfeeding is not bad -- in fact, it's strongly recommended by health experts for both infants and mothers due to its many health benefits. According to the NHMRC, exclusive breastfeeding for around the first six months and continuing up to 12 months or longer provides clear benefits for both infants and mothers. These benefits include optimal nutrition and improved health outcomes in both the short and long term. Similarly, the UK GP Infant Feeding Network notes that breastfeeding plays a crucial role in infant wellbeing, maternal health, and secure infant attachment. They, along with the World Health Organization, recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months, followed by continued breastfeeding alongside solid foods up to 2 years of age or beyond. So, while there may be public controversy or social challenges around breastfeeding, from a medical and health perspective, it is highly beneficial and not harmful.", "What is the NHMRC?", "The NHMRC is the National Health and Medical Research Council. According to https://www.healthdirect.gov.au, it is Australia's peak body for supporting health and medical research; for developing health advice for the Australian community, health professionals and governments; and for providing advice on ethical behaviour in health care and in the conduct of health and medical research. Do you want to learn more about the NHMRC?", "No thanks. But do I need to change my diet?", "Are you asking for your pregnancy or when breastfeeding?", "Oh, is it different? Then first during pregnancy!", "It's important to eat a wide range of foods while you are pregnant, so better to not focus on jam, rice and cake. Some highly nutritious foods for breakfast are dairy products, eggs, fish, green leafy vegetables, sweet potatoes, fruits, nuts and seeds. However, rice is not bad. For example, Jasmine rice is packed with folic acid. Folic acid has been linked to promoting healthy pregnancies, especially when taken before pregnancy and within the first trimester. Specifically, regular folic acid intake has been linked to reduced levels of birth defects and neural tube defects, making Jasmine rice a good choice. Similarly, cake is not bad. Carbohydrates, which includes cakes, are an important source of folate, a B group vitamin needed for the healthy development of babies in early pregnancy. Folate is important to create DNA and new red blood cells. It helps in reducing inflammation and protects the hearts from cardiovascular issues. It also aids in regulating blood pressure. Also, your favourite juice, orange juice, has a lot of folates. To sum up, you do not need to do without the things you like, but you should mix it up with other healthy foods!", "What about jam? You did not mention jam!", "You might have heard concern on eating jam during pregnancy because jam contains pectin, which the FDA banned in 1992 in over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. However, the American Academy of Family Physicians still recognizes it as a drug safe for use in pregnancy, indicating that it is safe to consume pectin in the very small amounts in which it is present in jams and other foods.", "So what about breastfeeding?", "You don't need a special diet while you're breastfeeding - just try to include a well-balanced, healthy variety of the following: Fruit and vegetables, starchy foods (carbohydrates), protein, dairy. You said you are interested in low-carb diets, but a low-carb diet can be dangerous to breastfeeding moms and has been reported to be life-threatening. While breastfeeding you need to drink more than you normally would. It is recommended that nursing moms drink about 12 glasses of water per day to stay well hydrated. The good news is that does not all have to be water. There are many great lactation drinks that can help to stay hydrated and produce more breast milk at the same time. For example, coconut water drinks for breastfeeding, lactation latte, or the breastfeeding protein shake. Importantly, contrary to some beliefs, studies have shown that alcohol interferes with the release of oxytocin which affects the let-down of breast milk, which means that rather than increasing milk supply, breast milk volumes are more likely to be lowered by alcohol.", "Does this mean I could run out of milk for my baby?", "Yes, though most mothers can breastfeed and produce enough milk for their babies if they have the right information, support and care. Moreover, each time your baby takes some milk from your breasts, your breasts get the message to make more milk. So, if you are running out of milk you could try fitting in a few extra breastfeeds each day. For example, if you're breastfeeding every 3-4 hours (from the start of one feed to the start of the next), you could try offering the baby a few extra snack breastfeeds in between.", "I'm soooooooooooooo excited! What else do I have to know?", "Some women get sore, cracked or painful nipples in the early days of breastfeeding. This usually happens if your baby isn't positioned or attached well at the breast. If a baby only sucks the nipple rather than taking a good mouthful of breast, then their tongue or roof of the mouth may rub on the nipple. Your midwife, health visitor or breastfeeding counsellor might be able to help identify any other underlying issues. Some women find rubbing breast milk onto their nipples can be soothing. Products like Vaseline or lanolin can help with dry or cracked nipples (although there's little evidence to show what really works well). After each feed, let your nipples dry before getting dressed - change your breast pads after every feed. Avoid using soap, as this can dry out your skin. If possible, only wear cotton, non-underwired bras. It's best to avoid using nipple shields and breast shells - these will not improve your baby's attachment to the breast. Try not to shorten feeds - doing so will not ease the pain and may reduce your milk supply. Moreover, you do not need to have your baby drink your milk directly. \"Expressing\" means taking milk from your breast without your baby suckling. You can use a pump or you can do it by hand."], "current_query": "That is good to know! Thanks, now I feel prepared to be a good mum and hope my baby does not need to cry.

{"sample_id": "6-1_14", "context": ["Hi, I am tired of my skin's appearance, and don't want to wear makeup anymore. What solutions are there except serums?", "Since you've been using makeup regularly and already incorporate vitamin C and retinol, are you now looking for something more clinical? Such as in-office treatments that go deeper, such as resurfacing or collagen-boosting procedures?", "Yes, I use La Roche-Posay products for my skin and hair, but I am looking for a fast solution. I have heard about CO2 lasers and microneedling. Are they good for me?", "Microneedling stimulates the production of collagen and elastin. The collagen hydrates the skin cells, making them plump and full. This naturally shrinks the size of the pores, making your skin look flawless and beautiful. Additionally, microneedling addresses dark spots by breaking up melanin clusters and stimulating skin cell regeneration to produce healthy, unpigmented new tissue. CO2 laser treatment is recommended for anyone who is looking to do the following: Minimize the visibility of wrinkles and fine lines on the face. Reduce the appearance of sun-damaged spots, minimize the size of pores, and reduce the overall look and texture of the skin. Achieve an all-over glow plus a younger and healthier appearance.", "How does it work?", "Which treatment do you mean?", "The latter.", "CO2 laser treatment uses a beam of light generated by electricity passing through a gas-filled tube. This light is delivered in short, concentrated pulses that target water in the skin, vaporizing damaged surface cells. It removes the top layer of skin, revealing smoother, fresher skin beneath, while also heating deeper layers to stimulate collagen production, which helps tighten and firm the skin over time. The treatment can be quite intense and may require general anaesthesia, especially for deeper procedures. Recovery time varies: fractional treatments might involve a few days of downtime, while fully ablative ones can require up to two weeks. During healing, the skin is typically swollen, scabbed, and raw, often with itching, discomfort, and minor pinpoint bleeding.", "That's too much! How about the other method?", "Microneedling requires very little downtime. Most people go back to doing their everyday activities after the treatment. However, you will experience some redness and irritation during the first few days. Therefore, you can apply a light layer of BB cream, tinted moisturizer, or light foundation to cover the redness. You should also apply non-comedogenic sunscreen before going outside. As far as healing times go, you can expect a full recovery after about a week. And after 2 to 3 weeks, you'll start seeing the results of the treatment.", "What is the difference between fractional and the other type that you mentioned?", "There are two types of CO2 lasers: fully ablative and fractional, with the primary difference being the extent of skin removal, or ablation. Fully ablative CO2 lasers completely remove the superficial skin in the treated area, as their name suggests, while simultaneously heating the deeper dermal layers to stimulate a regenerative healing response that promotes new collagen and elastin production. These treatments tend to be intense, often requiring general anaesthesia, and come with a minimum downtime of about two weeks. However, fully ablative CO2 lasers can paradoxically increase the risk of pigmentation issues and are generally recommended only for individuals with fair or light skin tones.", "Are there other techniques?", "Those with uneven skin color, dark spots, and pigmentation can benefit significantly from chemical peels, which involve applying specific chemicals to peel off the skin's top layer, allowing fresh, exfoliated skin to regenerate. Recovery time varies depending on the peel's depth: light peels typically require about a week, while medium to deep peels may need over a month for full healing. During recovery, it's essential to avoid abrasive skincare products or techniques to allow the skin to heal properly, and extra care must be taken as chemical peels increase sensitivity to sunlight. Another effective option is microdermabrasion, ideal for individuals looking to reduce signs of photoaging, uneven skin tone and texture, such as hyperpigmentation and melasma, fine lines and wrinkles, enlarged pores, atrophic or indented scars (including acne scars), and stretch marks. Safe for all skin types and tones--including darker skin--microdermabrasion works by mechanically buffing the epidermis using a handheld device that sprays exfoliating microcrystals to gently sand away dead skin cells, stimulating new, healthy skin growth. The procedure is generally painless and quick, usually taking around 30 minutes per session. Would you like me to compare these two methods in more detail?", "Yes.", "Microdermabrasion and chemical peels are both exfoliative treatments designed to improve skin texture and tone, offering benefits such as tightening the skin, reducing fine lines, evening out skin tone, and minimizing acne scars. While both procedures can be performed in-office by a clinician or at home, they work through different mechanisms: microdermabrasion physically exfoliates by scraping away the topmost layer of skin cells, whereas chemical peels use acid solutions to chemically peel away layers of skin. Chemical peels tend to be more effective for treating acne-prone and sensitive skin, but microdermabrasion is considered safer for darker skin tones. Neither treatment is suitable for all skin types, so careful consideration is needed before choosing one. Both microdermabrasion and light chemical peels can reduce the appearance of large pores--not by shrinking them, which isn't possible, but by clearing excess oil and debris that cause pore dilation, making them appear smaller. Additionally, both treatments help fade dark spots by removing the damaged, pigmented cells in the top layers of skin, allowing healthier new cells to surface. Alternative exfoliating options include laser therapy and at-home treatments, providing a range of choices depending on skin needs and sensitivities.", "What are the possible side effects?", "Side effects of microdermabrasion may include bruising, redness, swelling, tenderness, and in some cases, petechiae--small dark spots that indicate bleeding under the skin. Chemical peels can cause stinging, swelling, and redness, with the duration of these effects ranging from a few days to several weeks, depending on the strength of the peel. Medium and deep chemical peels carry a higher risk and can potentially lead to bacterial infections, so proper aftercare is essential.", "Thanks, but what about the rest?", "Side effects of laser skin resurfacing can include stinging, itching, peeling, swelling, and redness. After the procedure, your skin might feel like it's sunburned or remain pink for several months. It may also ooze or blister, and initially, there can be some darkening of the skin. Swelling is common for a day or two following the treatment. On the other hand, microneedling side effects may include peeling, bruising, bleeding, and a risk of bacterial infection. Redness after microneedling is normal and usually lasts only a few hours, typically subsiding by the next day. Other common effects include tingling sensations and slight dryness as the skin heals and exfoliates.", "Microneedling sounds good. Can I have my routine after doing it?", "Hyaluronic acid is the ultimate post-microneedling ingredient to look for, as it is a naturally occurring substance in the body known for its powerful hydrating and skin-replenishing properties. Applying hyaluronic acid after microneedling enhances its absorption, allowing the serum or treatment to penetrate deeper and work more effectively due to the temporary micro-channels created in the skin. However, it's crucial to avoid applying retinol, makeup, and strong exfoliating acids such as AHAs (alpha hydroxy acids) and BHAs (beta hydroxy acids) immediately after microneedling, as these can cause irritation or even worsen skin sensitivity. It's recommended to wait at least 24 hours post-treatment before using makeup to avoid introducing pore-clogging or irritating ingredients into freshly treated skin. If you use exfoliants containing AHAs like lactic, glycolic, or mandelic acid, apply them either the day before microneedling or wait at least two days after a session--especially when using devices like the Banisher. Additionally, while Vitamin C is a popular antioxidant, it can be sensitizing for some individuals post-microneedling, so it's best to use a gentle, naturally derived, or specifically formulated version to reduce the risk of irritation.", "I have an oily scalp and hair, and oily skin. I also have a face wash with salicylic acid in my routine. Can I continue to use them after the treatment?", "Skincare products containing salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, etc., should not be used since they slow down the regeneration process or maybe harm the skin after the treatment. Apply gentle products for at least a week, and it is also advised to find products suitable for your skin after micro-needling. You can use them after at least three days of the treatment to give you satisfactory results.", "I have also heard about Mephzotheraphy for improving the skin. Is it better than micro-needling?", "Sorry, I couldn't find anything about \"Mephzotheraphy\". Do you mean Mesotherapy? Mesotherapy and microneedling are both popular skin treatments, but they work in different ways and serve slightly different purposes. Microneedling uses tiny needles to create micro-injuries in the skin, which stimulates collagen production and improves texture, scars, and fine lines. Mesotherapy, on the other hand, involves injecting a blend of vitamins, hyaluronic acid, and other nutrients directly into the skin to boost hydration, radiance, and superficial rejuvenation. If your goal is deeper skin renewal and firming, microneedling may be more effective. For added glow and hydration, mesotherapy is a great choice. Some people combine both treatments for more comprehensive results."], "current_query": "Ah I see. Never mind.

{"sample_id": "7-1_13", "context": ["I'd like to bake bread at home. Can you help me with that?", "You can absolutely start baking bread at home with the right setup and approach! There are a few things to have in mind before you start: Control over ingredients: Baking at home allows you to choose what goes into your bread, which is especially helpful if you have allergies or want to limit certain ingredients. Convenience: Using a bread machine makes the process easy and mess-free. You simply select the desired setting, and the machine handles the mixing, rising, and baking. Cost savings: Although store-bought bread might seem cheaper, baking at home can save you money in the long run, especially if you have dietary needs. Better quality: For professional-quality bread, having the right equipment, especially a good oven with proper heat settings, is important. A baking stone is also recommended. Optional tools: A dough mixer can be useful if you prefer not to knead by hand, but it's not essential for starting out. Can I help you further?", "Thank you. How about bread machines?", "Bread machines are smart, time-saving tools that make homemade baking easy and enjoyable. A bread machine is a compact kitchen appliance that mixes, kneads, proofs, and bakes bread automatically. It has a built-in paddle, and a bread pan inside a small oven, controlled electronically. You just add ingredients in the specified order, choose your settings (like bread type, loaf size, and crust darkness), and press Start. The machine handles everything else: preheating, kneading, rising, baking, and even keeping the bread warm. Besides bread, many machines can also make dough for pizza, pasta, pretzels, and even jam or meatloaf, depending on the model. It's designed to be a low-effort, mess-free way to enjoy homemade bread with full control over ingredients. Do you need tips on choosing the right bread machine for your needs?", "No, I'm more into baking the bread myself in the oven.", "Oven baking does require more time, manual kneading (unless you use a mixer), and some experience with baking times and temperatures. But since you're passionate about the process, baking in the oven is a rewarding and customizable way to make great bread. Baking bread in the oven is often preferred for its superior flavor and texture. Oven-baked bread tends to be lighter, airier, and better for slicing compared to the denser texture of bread machine loaves. You get full control over every step of the process which appeals to many who enjoy the craft of baking. For someone who enjoys baking and likes to be challenged, baking in oven can be a rewarding experience.", "Sounds interesting. Can you suggest some recipes?", "Do you have any dietary preferences (gluten-free, vegan, etc.)?", "No, I don't have any, but I prefer healthy options.", "If you're looking for healthy bread options, baking at home gives you a big advantage. You can choose exactly what goes into your loaf. If you're baking in the oven and want healthy options, start with whole grains, incorporate nutritious add-ins, and choose recipes based on spelt, flax, or whole wheat flour. You'll get a healthier loaf that supports digestion, heart health, and stable energy. Some healthy bread options: Spelt Bread: made from an ancient grain with lower gluten, it's filling and has a nutty flavor; Lavash Bread: a simple flatbread made from flour, water, and salt. It's versatile and low in calories; Turkish Flatbread: low in calories and great for wraps or sandwiches; Whole Wheat Bread: a classic choice that's high in fiber and protein. Just ensure it's 100% whole wheat; Ezekiel Bread or Flax Bread: these are made from sprouted grains and seeds, offering extra fiber and nutrients.", "How do Turkish and lavash compare?", "Turkish flatbread and lavash are both traditional flatbreads from the Middle East and surrounding regions, but they differ in ingredients, texture, and how they are typically used. Both are healthy, traditional options. Lavash if you want a thinner, more versatile wrap; Turkish flatbread if you're after something heartier and more filling. Lavash has deep cultural roots across Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, and Turkey, while Turkish flatbread specifically originates from Turkey and is more like a leavened, fluffy bread compared to other flatbreads. Lavash is traditionally made with unleavened dough, while Turkish flatbread is made with yeast-leavened dough. Lavash is commonly used to wrap or scoop food, especially with kebabs. Turkish flatbread, instead, is often cut open and filled like a sandwich or pita and is best eaten fresh.", "No, health", "Lavash bread is made simply with flour, water, and salt. It is described as versatile, can be eaten soft or crunchy, and is used in dishes like Lavash Bread Pizza, which is referred to as \"relatively healthy.\" Turkish flatbread, although usually served as the \"unhealthy wrapper for a greasy kebab,\" is still listed among the top five healthy breads due to its low calories and versatility. It can be baked, stuffed, or grilled, and is suggested as a lower-carb option that still satisfies hunger. Additionally, you can go wholewheat with the Turkish flatbread.", "I have fatty liver.", "Are you looking for dietary recommendations given your condition?", "Yes, bread", "Sure, here are some general dietary information on breads, given your condition of fatty liver. You should avoid white bread, as it contains refined wheat flour, added sugars, high fructose corn syrup, and bleached flour, all of which are harmful to the liver and can spike blood sugar levels. Instead, choose whole wheat bread and bread made from whole wheat flour, which contain complex carbohydrates that are digested more slowly and have a lower impact on blood sugar; Rye bread, especially when mixed with whole wheat flour; Ketobreads (if made at home), though they are harder to prepare; Sprouted whole-grain products, such as sprouted bread, which are richer in fiber, antioxidants, and essential amino acids, and promote gut and liver health. Even healthy bread should be eaten in moderation (no more than 2-3 slices per day) to support liver recovery.", "Make it shorter.", "If you have fatty liver, avoid white bread as it's made with refined, bleached flour and added sugars that harm the liver and spike blood sugar. Instead, choose: Rye bread (best when mixed with whole wheat flour); whole wheat bread; sprouted whole-grain bread; homemade ketobread (if you can make it). Eat bread in moderation (no more than 2-3 slices per day) to support liver healing.", "Ok. I have some basic tools at home. What else do I need to get?", "Here's home baking must-haves.

Also for the cushion one, I always find out they slip off, making it super uncomfortable.", "Professional and advanced level cyclists avoid gel bike seats because it becomes uncomfortable on long rides. Also, it loses spring-back property more quickly. The gel tends to get compacted and loses its shape faster than foam. Concerning the one that you add over the seat, some have side strings that are tied to the seat pole to enhance the fit. Some also have an anti-slip texture as an interior design, which fixes it to the bike seat without chances of sliding off.", "I like the softness of gel seats. It is very important to me to feel comfortable; I used to have back pain a lot. So let me consider a gel cushion adds-on seat. Are there any other important features to consider?", "Since you ride a mountain bike and comfort is a top priority, especially with your history of back pain, there are several features beyond foam or gel that are worth considering when choosing a saddle. First, the shape of the saddle really matters. Mountain biking involves a lot of movement and shifting positions, especially on rough or hilly terrain. A narrower saddle helps with maneuverability, while a wider rear provides better support for your sit bones. You'll want something that balances both. Also, durability and weather resistance are important, especially since you ride in the rain and on forest paths. Look for a weatherproof cover that won't get slick or degrade quickly in wet conditions. Saddle height and positioning also play a role in comfort. If you're riding cross-country, a slightly higher saddle can help with pedaling efficiency. For more technical trails or downhill rides, a lower saddle improves control. You might even want to consider a dropper post if you're doing both. Finally, padding isn't everything, comfort also depends on how well the saddle fits your body and riding style. Many mountain bike saddles are designed to support the sit bones while staying streamlined enough for effective pedaling. Would you like some help narrowing it down to a few specific models?", "I meant other than the seat.", "For better comfort, would you like to explore things like suspension, handlebar setup, or maybe adjusting your tire pressure?", "I know about tire pressure, but for the hands yes.", "For mountain biking, the handlebar setup has a big impact on comfort and control. The right width, rise, and sweep can improve posture, reduce wrist strain, and make technical terrain easier to handle. Wider bars offer more stability for downhill or fast trails, while shorter bars help with tight turns. Riser bars give you a more upright position, great if you've had back pain, and a comfortable sweep keeps your wrists in a natural position. Handlebars are usually made of carbon or aluminum. Carbon absorbs more vibrations for added comfort, while aluminum is more durable and budget-friendly. Combined with good grips, the right handlebar setup can make your rides much more enjoyable.", "Interesting, I will probably consider buying a new grip. By the way, I am not sure about the material of my bike, how to know exactly? And where are we now about budget?", "To find out what material your bike is made of, start by checking the weight, it can give you a clue. Carbon fiber components are very light, strong, and absorb vibrations well, often found on high-end bikes. Aluminium is the most common frame material, known for being both durable and lightweight. Steel is heavier but very strong and offers a smooth ride. Sometimes, especially on road bikes, the fork might be made of a different material than the frame, so check that too. Look for labels on the frame or handlebar or check the manufacturer's website for exact details. About the budget, you can get a new grip for around 10 to 20 euros, and a gel bike cushion seat for also around 20 to 30 euros.", "I have been thinking about my plastic pedals too.", "That makes sense, plastic pedals can wear down quickly and get slippery, especially in wet or muddy conditions. For mountain biking, flat platform pedals made from aluminum or magnesium are a solid upgrade. They typically have metal traction pins that dig into your shoe soles, giving you way more grip and control. They also hold up better to impacts from rocks or roots. If you want something that balances grip, durability, and ease of use, flat pedals with sealed bearings and a wide platform are a great choice.", "That sounds good, what are the key things to look for?", "A few things really matter when choosing flat pedals. First, go for a robust body material, aluminum and magnesium offer better strength-to-weight ratios than plastic. Second, look for replaceable metal pins; they provide superior grip, and you can swap them out if they wear down. You'll also want sealed bearings or bushings, which protect against dirt and moisture, especially if you ride through wet forests or muddy trails. Lastly, check the platform size, a wider platform gives more stability, especially with trail or downhill shoes. If you can, try a model with slightly concave shape, it helps lock your foot in place naturally."], "current_query": "Are clipless pedals worth considering?", "predicted_rewrite": ["Are clipless pedals worth considering for my mountain bike?", "Are clipless pedals worth considering for my mountain bike?", "Are clipless pedals worth considering for my mountain bike?", "Are clipless pedals worth considering for my mountain bike?", "Are clipless pedals worth considering for my mountain biking?", "Are clipless pedals worth considering for my mountain bike?", "Are clipless pedals worth considering for my mountain bike?", "Are clipless pedals a good option to consider for my mountain bike?", "Are clipless pedals worth considering for my mountain bike?", "Are clipless pedals worth considering for my mountain bike?"], "predicted_response": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}

{"sample_id": "9-2_10", "context": ["Hi, my bike chain keeps going out, what is the issue?", "There is probably an issue with your chain, or gears, would you like a DIY guide, or do you prefer to go to a bike shop for them to fix it?", "I rather fix it myself, I have some tools, and some time.", "There are lots of reasons why your chain could be jumping off, or even going out. First, it can be just common wear, if you had your bike for long time, it is normal you need to change the chains regularly. It is especially true if you bike in rainy weather or mud. Another reason could also be the derailleur. When you change speed, the derailleur shifts the chain, if it is not well adjusted it can go too far in one direction, or even still shift it although there is no gear to catch it. This can be adjusted easily, just check limit screws labelled \"H\" and \"L\" for \"High\" and \"Low\" limits.", "I just checked, the derailleur seems to be fine, it is well aligned with each gear, and it doesn't go too far on the right or on the left after shifting the speed. Maybe it is related to the chain then?", "Indeed, related to the chain it might be wear, or the chain being not on the correct length. It can also be the teeth of your cassette being damaged. Can you tell me more about your bike, did you buy it recently? or changed some parts recently?", "I bought this bike one month ago, the chain was changed when I bought it, and the gear don't look damaged.", "Then it is probably not worn, and more likely a problem of chain length. The next step would be to check the length of the chain. To do that, go on the largest chairing and largest cog, you should be able to do the shift easily. On the other side, go on the smallest cog, there you should see that the jockey still has some tension. Let me know once you did those two steps if you notice something abnormal.", "Wait, what is the jockey?", "Your rear derailleur features an upper and a lower jockey wheel, and these perform different jobs. The upper jockey wheel, also known as the guide pulley, is the one that is in charge of shifting duties when you change speed. The lower jockey wheel is also known as the tension pulley, because it helps to keep the chain tensioned in each gear combination. Both are two small wheels next to your gears on the back wheel.", "I tried to go on the largest gears, and I see that the chain seems a bit loose. How to know the perfect length?", "If your chain feels loose on the largest gears, it might be too long. One way to check the ideal chain length is by using this formula: L = 2(C) + (F/4 + R/4 + 1) where: L is the chain length in inches, C is the distance from the crank center to the rear axle (the chain stay), F is the number of teeth on the largest front chainring, R is the number of teeth on the largest rear cog. You can measure the chain stay and count the teeth on your gears to calculate it. Let me know if you'd like help doing this step by step or identifying these parts on your bike.", "I'm not good with math", "Ok. here is another more hands-on method, also very reliable, called the big-big method. You can remove your chain from the gears, and from the derailleur, then wrap the chain against the largest front chainring and rear cog, skipping the derailleur, and then pull it tight. This gives you the reference length, on which you can add two extra links. Do you have a chain breaker tool to do it? I would also advise you to use a bike repair stand if you have one, it might avoid you some back pain.", "That's much better, thanks, yes I have a chain breaker, but you can remind me how to use it, and also how to open my chain?", "You should be able to identify a master link on your chain - a special link that join the two ends of the chain. Once you identified the master link, you can open your chain, then use the chain breaker to remove the number of links you need. To remove the links, you just need to align the chain breaker with a pivot/pin or a link and then push the pin out, once the pin is out, the link will automatically drop.", "Thanks, great it worked. What should I use to lubricate my chain now? Can I use car oil?", "You could use motor oil, but it is not the ideal case because bike and car oils have different properties. Car motor oil is made to resist to extreme temperature, while bike grease needs to resist to water. If you apply your grease correctly, you could easily bike for 200 miles without any problem, while with poor quality oil, you might have to do extra maintenance."], "current_query": "How to know when to add grease again?", "predicted_rewrite": ["How can I determine when to add grease to my bike chain again?", "How can I tell when to add grease to my bike chain again?", "How can I determine when to add lubricant to my bike chain again?", "How can I determine when to add lubrication to my bike chain again?", "How do I know when to add lubricant to my bike chain again?", "How can I tell when to add lubricant to my bike chain again?", "How can I determine when to add grease to my bike chain again?", "How can I determine when to reapply grease to my bike chain?", "How can I tell when it's time to add lubricant to my bike chain again?", "How can I determine when to reapply grease to my bike chain?"], "predicted_response": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}
