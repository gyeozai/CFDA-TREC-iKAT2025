This can cause a burning sensation in your heart and chest, which we often refer to as \"heartburn.\" Over time, prolonged acid reflux can cause damage to the esophagus and potentially lead to the chronic form of the condition called GERD. Acid reflux happens due to improper functioning of the LES. Acid reflux normally happens when we eat certain foods that stimulate excess acid production; however, for some people, genetics plays a role in reflux. Eating large meals, lying down straight after eating, or snacking close to bedtime are also common triggers of reflux. Being overweight means that you are more likely to suffer from reflux because of increased pressure on your stomach, which can force open the valve after a meal. Some people find that acid reflux is worse when they are stressed. Acid reflux also happens due to a weakness of the sphincter muscle, or when the stomach produces too much acid and not enough protective mucus. There is also something called a hiatus hernia; due to a gap in the diaphragm, parts of the stomach can move into the chest, which increases the risk of reflux.", "I have a deadline approaching.

Garlic is nutrient-dense (rich in vitamins B6, C, manganese, selenium, etc.) and very low in calories, so it's easy to include in your meals without adding excess energy.

Arabica beans have sweeter and more complex flavors than Robusta coffee beans, which is why they currently dominate coffee markets, especially specialty coffee markets. Arabica coffee beans have a bright acidity, medium body, and multiple layers of flavor. They are well suited to be brewed pour-over style, which lets their subtleties shine more than espresso or immersion brewing. 2) Robusta is the second most commonly grown type of coffee bean. Robusta's name comes from being more robust than the Arabica plants, which is why you can grow it in a broader range of environments. Therefore, it is less prone to disease. However, despite these advantages, it remains less popular than Arabica because its flavors and aromas aren't as desirable. Robusta beans are known for having a darker, earthier flavor, and for this reason, they are most often subjected to a darker roast to better match their natural character. Robusta beans also have nearly twice the caffeine of Arabica beans. While Robusta beans are generally considered lower quality than Arabica, this is not necessarily the case. There are a growing number of farmers and processors working to develop high-quality Robusta beans and Robusta-Arabica hybrids. 3) Liberica beans make up only about 2% of the world's current coffee crop. Once upon a time, this varietal was far more critical after disease wiped out much of the world's Arabica supply. Arabica has since made a comeback, and Liberica production has primarily ceased. However, that may change in the future, as climate change makes it increasingly challenging to produce the more sensitive Arabica plants reliably. Liberica coffee has a unique flavor, pairing floral and fruity notes with a deep smokiness that some describe as woody. It has a full-bodied, reminiscent of Robusta coffee. It's not to everyone's taste, but there are some exceptional Liberica coffees to be had when done right. 4) Excelsa has recently been reclassified as a type of Liberica coffee because it thrives in the same conditions and grows a similarly tall tree. But the actual coffee it produces is vastly different. It has a much fruitier character than Liberica, with a tart acidity that makes it popular for adding complexity to coffee blends. Excelsa coffee makes up only about 7% of the current coffee market. Still, given its appealing flavor profile and the fact that it is nearly as resilient and productive as Robusta, this seems likely to grow.

As they spend more time roasting, they become much darker and release some extra oil as well. This also really impacts the flavor of the coffee. It's also important to note that a large amount of coffee's natural caffeine content is lost as roasting continues. The longer you cook or roast something, the fewer nutrients remain. As you roast coffee for longer, the chlorogenic acid begins to seep out. Chlorogenic acid is considered an antioxidant, which means it repairs your body and protects you from diseases like cancer. There are four common roast levels: Light roasts (also called cinnamon roasts) retain the most caffeine and acidity.

Adding butter instead of milk can be a great tasting alternative to making your coffee taste great. If you want to make sure that you are losing weight, you should make sure that you are using low-fat butter and no sugar in your cup of coffee. There are artificial sweeteners that you can add to the coffee, but this isn't something that many people are fond of. It can ruin the taste of the coffee. If you are really looking for a sweet taste in your coffee, without adding sugar or artificial sweeteners, you can add a small amount of cinnamon to your coffee. The secret is to add a pinch of salt to the coffee. You need to add just a small amount of salt to the coffee. This is going to counteract the bitterness and give a sweeter, smoother taste.", "Thanks for the information, but my problem is mainly with the taste of coffee itself.", "The different types of coffee beans, the quality of the coffee beans, and the roast type all influence the quality of the coffee taste. Then, the water also has an effect on the taste of your cup of coffee. Using filtered water or bottled water will ensure that your coffee is always tasting great. If your coffee beans are ground too finely, your coffee will be over-extracted and bitter. You need to strike the right balance with your drip coffee grind size. On the other hand, if the coffee grains are too big, the water will pass through them quickly, resulting in under-extracted coffee that is flat and weak.", "I don't want it to be sour.", "Sour coffee is a symptom of under-extraction during the brewing process, which means the grind has to be fine enough to allow the extraction at a rapid pace. You will end up with sour coffee if your water is not hot enough to extract the good flavors from the beans. You can turn the tide by using a higher coffee-to-water ratio. Specifically, you'll need to brew more coffee with less water. Stale coffee beans are victims of oxidation, and they often have a sharp lemony flavor that's simply off. If you brew these beans, you'll end up with sour coffee.", "Tell me about different ones.", "Sure, are you looking for non-sour coffee beans?", "No, I am asking generally.", "There are four different types of coffee beans in the world. 1) Arabica makes up most coffee grown at present, accounting for about 60% of commercial coffee production. It originated in Ethiopia, where it grows wild. However, people first cultivated it in Yemen, and it is from there that it takes its name. Arabica beans have sweeter and more complex flavors than Robusta coffee beans, which is why they currently dominate coffee markets, especially specialty coffee markets. Arabica coffee beans have a bright acidity, medium body, and multiple layers of flavor. They are well suited to be brewed pour-over style, which lets their subtleties shine more than espresso or immersion brewing. 2) Robusta is the second most commonly grown type of coffee bean. Robusta's name comes from being more robust than the Arabica plants, which is why you can grow it in a broader range of environments. Therefore, it is less prone to disease. However, despite these advantages, it remains less popular than Arabica because its flavors and aromas aren't as desirable. Robusta beans are known for having a darker, earthier flavor, and for this reason, they are most often subjected to a darker roast to better match their natural character. Robusta beans also have nearly twice the caffeine of Arabica beans. While Robusta beans are generally considered lower quality than Arabica, this is not necessarily the case. There are a growing number of farmers and processors working to develop high-quality Robusta beans and Robusta-Arabica hybrids. 3) Liberica beans make up only about 2% of the world's current coffee crop. Once upon a time, this varietal was far more critical after disease wiped out much of the world's Arabica supply. Arabica has since made a comeback, and Liberica production has primarily ceased. However, that may change in the future, as climate change makes it increasingly challenging to produce the more sensitive Arabica plants reliably. Liberica coffee has a unique flavor, pairing floral and fruity notes with a deep smokiness that some describe as woody. It has a full-bodied, reminiscent of Robusta coffee. It's not to everyone's taste, but there are some exceptional Liberica coffees to be had when done right. 4) Excelsa has recently been reclassified as a type of Liberica coffee because it thrives in the same conditions and grows a similarly tall tree. But the actual coffee it produces is vastly different. It has a much fruitier character than Liberica, with a tart acidity that makes it popular for adding complexity to coffee blends. Excelsa coffee makes up only about 7% of the current coffee market. Still, given its appealing flavor profile and the fact that it is nearly as resilient and productive as Robusta, this seems likely to grow. Much like Robusta, Excelsa coffee has been regarded as poor quality, but this is more due to poor growing and processing practices than the bean itself. With the proper care, Excelsa has the potential to be specialty-grade coffee.", "Wow, that's a lot of information! Can you compare the caffeine content and shape of the last two ones?", "The caffeine levels in excelsa beans range from 0.86 to 1.13g per 100g, while the caffeine concentration of liberica beans is 1.23 g/100 g. The liberica bean is shaped like an almond, whereas excelsa beans are smaller and rounder.", "Taste", "Do you mean Excelsa and Liberica?", "Yes.", "Excelsa coffees tend to have fruity and tart-like tasting notes with a hint of smokiness, which can remind you of a darkly roasted coffee. But it also has some complexity and depth, which is why it's used in blends. With Liberica, you'll find a floral or even fruity aroma as well as a full body. They also have a relatively smoky or even woody flavor that's quite distinctive.", "Which one do you suggest to me?", "I suggest Liberica because its beans are known for their bold, smoky, and woody flavors with subtle floral and fruity undertones. This profile offers a rich and full-bodied taste without the bright acidity found in some other coffee beans. Compared to Arabica and Robusta beans, Liberica has a lower acidity, making it a gentler choice for individuals sensitive to acidic beverages.", "Thanks, now tell me about the impact of roasting.", "Are you curious about the impact of roasting on coffee taste?", "Yes, and I am looking for the best option for me.", "The degradation of simple sugars and polysaccharides during roasting creates sweet and caramelized aromas. As they spend more time roasting, they become much darker and release some extra oil as well. This also really impacts the flavor of the coffee. It's also important to note that a large amount of coffee's natural caffeine content is lost as roasting continues. The longer you cook or roast something, the fewer nutrients remain. As you roast coffee for longer, the chlorogenic acid begins to seep out. Chlorogenic acid is considered an antioxidant, which means it repairs your body and protects you from diseases like cancer. There are four common roast levels: Light roasts (also called cinnamon roasts) retain the most caffeine and acidity. You'll taste more of the floral or fruity notes of the bean and get a thinner body. Medium roasts: This is the most balanced of the roasts. You'll get some acidity with more sweetness and aroma. They're the most common roast in the United States, which has led to the nickname American roast. Medium-dark roasts: Also called city roasts, these have the bittersweet aftertaste most people associate with coffee. They have a high aroma and sweetness with almost no acidity, and may have some visible oil on the surface of the beans. Dark roasts: You may also hear this called a French roast or Italian roast.

This is not advisable. Even without going as far as the surgery, it can lead to a worsening of the tear, a bowstring, over-compensation from another part of your hand and risk of further injuries. Your body might also do inadequate healing with excessive scar tissue and limit your flexibility in the future.", "I will take it slow and take a few weeks off. What are some advice for when I start again?", "That's a good spirit. It is advised to spend the first weeks climbing relatively easy routes with big holds, good footholds and keeping sessions short. Stay away from overhangs and campus boards. You can return to full-force climbing if easy climbing yields no pain. Continue taping (it will also serve as a mental note of the previous injury) and avoid tweaky crimps and pockets for several months.

How to tape?", "Yes, it is totally understandable, many people prefer not to take supplements. When it comes to taping, it can be a helpful way to protect an injured pulley. Since taping restricts finger movement, it prevents you from using the injured area in ways that could make the damage worse, making it a generally safe and recommended approach. According to Dave Saunders, a physiotherapist and climbing injury specialist known for his work on hand and finger injuries in climbers, effective taping for A2 and A3 pulley injuries should limit the finger's ability to bend at the middle joint. To apply the tape correctly, note the three creases on the front of your finger, starting from the base. With your finger straight, begin taping from halfway between the first and second crease and finish halfway between the second and third, overlapping the tape by 50%. Once taped, you'll notice you can't crimp anymore, which is actually a good thing for healing.

{"sample_id": "3-1_11", "context": ["Hi, I have pain in my finger, can you help me?", "Hi, is this pain related to your climbing activities? or something else?", "Not sure, but it might be.", "Finger pain after climbing is pretty common, climber's finger is one of the most common climbing injuries within the sport of rock climbing, accounting for about 30% of finger injuries seen in climbers. Whether it's problematic depends on a few factors, including the intensity of the pain and the location. Can you tell me where exactly the pain is located? Is it in the pulley, the joint, or the tendon? I can also provide you with a detailed anatomy of the finger if you cannot localize it yourself.", "Yes please, I don't really know, it could be the tendon.", "That's totally fair, it can be hard to tell, so let's break down the anatomy of the finger. Three bones and three hinged joints make up the finger. Ligaments connect and stabilize the bones, while tendons connect muscle to bone, transferring to the bone any forces created by the muscles. Flexor tendons in the fingers attach to muscles in the forearms that pull on the tendons, bend the fingers, and allow us to crimp. Connective tissue encases the tendons, forming a sheath with five thickened areas that create the annular pulleys (A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5), which keep the tendon close to the bone when bending the fingers.", "Thanks, but please relate your answer to my pain? How is the pain on those different areas?", "Yes sure. Most common climbing injuries actually come from pulley, sometimes with a loud \"pop\" and then significant swelling and pain. For A2 pulley injuries, the most common pulley injury for climbers, the pain usually arises at the base of the finger and is noticeable when trying to straighten or bend the finger. For A2-A4 ruptures, there may be bowstringing, bulging at the base of the finger, which can be detected by resisting finger bending at the fingertip. Those are usually associated with pain on the front of the finger. Otherwise, if you see difficulties with bending your finger, this can be due to damage on the tendon, it can be the case if you also have an open injury or a cut on the open side of your hand. Finally, if you feel that the pain is more on the side of the finger, then this might be the collateral ligaments of the fingers.", "I have pain in the front of the finger, especially when crimping, but I cannot see any bowstring, can this still be the A2 pulley?", "When you bend your finger, normally the tendon stays snug against the bone because the pulleys hold it down. In very serious cases, if you have a complete rupture of the pulley (especially A2), the tendon lifts off the bone, forming a visible or palpable \"bowstring\" under the skin. However, you can also have just a strain on the A2 pulley, with pain when crimping, which is less serious than the complete rupture, but still needs some rest. It is a good sign if you don't have a visible bowstring.", "I understand, what are the next steps?", "If you have pain in your A2 pulley as a climber, here is what to do next, depending on the severity of the injury: Grade 1: Pulley sprain. A partial tear of a single pulley. Solution: No need for immobilization. Begin gentle range-of-motion exercises, bend the finger until it feels tight, hold for 2-3 seconds, relax, and repeat 10 times for several sessions each day. Now perform the same exercise, only straighten the finger. Avoid pushing through pain. Grade 2: Complete A4 or partial A2, A3 tear/rupture. Either the A4 pulley is completely torn, or A2 and A3 are both partially torn. Solution: One to two weeks of immobilization with a finger-immobilization splint or a pulley-protection splint. Gentle range-of-motion exercises. If it persists, you can seek a diagnosis from a climbing-knowledgeable physician or orthopaedic surgeon, who can assess the damage with an ultrasound or MRI. This will help determine the level of care needed, as well as confirm and check possible damage to the rest of your hand.", "I don't think I want to do an MRI. Anyway, what are the risks if I don't rest?", "You risk damaging the pulley even more, which can be very dangerous and lead to surgery. From past patients that went through the surgery, most of them complained of reduced finger dexterity while performing their daily activities and work, and not being able to perform as they use to at climbing.

To apply an H-tape correctly, start with a piece of athletic tape about 4 inches long and the full width of the roll. From each end, tear lengthwise inward, stopping about half an inch before reaching the centre, so you are left with a narrow \"bridge\" between two tails. This creates the \"H\" shape. Place the central bridge of the tape over the palmar side (the inner surface) of the middle joint of the injured finger. Start by wrapping the two tails around the section of the finger closer to the palm (proximal phalanx), anchoring it firmly. Then, slightly bend the finger, about 30 degrees at the joint, and wrap the other two tails around the section of the finger beyond the joint (middle phalanx). This technique limits extension and flexion at the joint, providing mechanical support to reduce stress on the injured pulley while still allowing controlled movement for rehab."], "current_query": "Should I tape other fingers as well when training?", "predicted_rewrite": ["Should I tape my other fingers during climbing training to prevent injury?", "Should I tape my other fingers when training for climbing to prevent injuries?", "Should I tape my other fingers while training for climbing to prevent injuries?", "Should I tape my other fingers while training for climbing to prevent injuries?", "Should I tape my other fingers while training for climbing to prevent injuries?", "Should I tape my other fingers as well for injury prevention while training for climbing?", "Should I tape my other fingers as well during climbing training for injury prevention and support?", "Should I tape my other fingers as well when training for climbing to prevent injuries?", "Should I tape my other fingers when training for climbing to prevent injuries?", "Should I tape my other fingers as well during climbing training for injury prevention and rehabilitation?", "Should I tape my other fingers as well when training for climbing to prevent injuries?", "Should I tape my other fingers while training for climbing to prevent injury?", "Should I tape my other fingers as well while training for climbing to prevent injuries?", "Should I tape my other fingers during climbing training to prevent injuries?", "Should I tape my other fingers while training for climbing to prevent injuries?", "Should I tape my other fingers when training for climbing to prevent injuries?"], "predicted_response": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}

{"sample_id": "4-1_12", "context": ["Hi, I want to prepare for a run.", "Great, preparing for a run can mean different things depending on your goal, timing, and fitness level. Can you clarify a few things so I can help you better?", "It's a 10 miles.", "Great! Here's a checklist to get you started on your 10-mile training journey: 1. Plan Ahead: Training for a 10-mile run takes time, ideally several months. Start preparing early to build your endurance gradually and safely. 2. Run Slow to Get Strong: Focus on building endurance by running at a comfortable pace. Your long-run pace should be about 1 to 2 minutes per mile slower than your short-run or race pace. Plan a long run every other weekend, increasing the distance by about half a mile each time. The key is consistency and patience. 3. Set Your Own Goals: If you're aged 17 to 21 and in good health, running a 6:30 mile puts you in the top 1% for that age group, according to the U.S. Army standards. That translates to a 1:05:00 finish for 10 miles. But remember that your journey is yours alone. 4. Practice Mid-Run Fuelling: For any run longer than 60 minutes, your body will need fuel. Whether it's energy gels, dates, or other snacks, experiment during training to find what works best for you. Never try something new on race day. 5. Stay Hydrated: A portable water bottle or hydration belt is a must for long runs. Try different setups and go with what feels most comfortable for you. Let me know if you want further help on how to organize your training, for example, how many days per week do you want to train? What time of day works best for you to run? What is your current fitness level?", "No, it's a 10 km.", "Sure, let me update the checklist for a 10 km: 1. It's good to start 9 to 12 weeks in advance, some plans will even propose you with training in one month. 2. Still training with slow paces, is better to build your endurance, 1-2 min per km slower than your target time is good. 3. Keeping the pace of 4:00 min per km, you can finish in 40 min. Generally, between 40 min and 1 hour is a good target time. 4. Fuelling is not as important for less than 1 hour races, so for 10km it is not mandatory. 5. You still need to stay hydrated, especially if you are in a hot place like Spain.", "Ohh, no the run will not be in Spain, it is a 10km run in New York next Spring, April. I don't know about the weather.", "Thanks for the clarification, the temperature in New York during Spring will usually kick off in April and reach highs of 16degC on average. It's the perfect temperature for a 10 km run, but you still need good hydration. Early March, you will still have some possible rains, but as it goes toward April the weather is warmer with less risk of rains during your run.", "Give me a typical workout week.", "Here is a plan for a week: Monday: easy run 50 min. Tuesday: Intervals 5 x 1600m at 10k pace, 2 min rest. Wednesday: easy run 50 min, Thursday: rest day. Friday: tempo 2 x 10 mins, 3 min rest. Saturday: rest day. Sunday: long run 60 mins. This could be a balanced workout with 2 days of rest per week. You can follow this plan for 6 to 8 weeks. Of course before the race take 2 days of rest, the last thing you want is to have drained legs on the run day.", "My run is in 4 months, I have more than 8 weeks.", "This is not a problem, you can build even better endurance, the only risk is that you could lose motivation. You can run casually for the time being but be sure to focus on targeted exercise when you arrive closer to the race. For the final weeks, the idea will be to run slightly faster than your lactate threshold and learning to sustain a hard effort when tired.", "How can I figure out my threshold?", "While exercising above the threshold, more lactate is produced than can be removed from the muscle. A reliable test method for the threshold is the talk test. If you are exercising and can explain easily to someone what you (for example) did on the weekend, you are below the threshold. If you have difficulty explaining, you are at the threshold. And if you can't, then you are above the threshold.", "I also don't have shoes.", "Running shoes are important because they directly affect your comfort, performance, and risk of injury.

Cauliflower rice is one of the best low-carb options, with very few calories and carbs, and it's quick to prepare. Quinoa is higher in protein and fiber than white rice and cooks in just 15 minutes, making it a nutritious, easy choice, though not as low in carbs. Black rice is naturally gluten-free and packed with antioxidants, even more than blueberries, with a slightly sweet, nutty flavor. Wild rice and brown rice also offer more protein and fiber than white rice, though they are not as low in carbs, making them better suited if you are focusing on nutrient density rather than strict carb reduction.

For sweeteners, stevia is a top choice, followed by xylitol, erythritol, and yacon syrup. Natural options like honey, molasses or maple syrup are better than white sugar but should still be used in moderation. Yogurt is another great substitute, using one cup of fat-free yogurt instead of oil can lighten the recipe, just be sure to adjust other liquids to avoid an overly wet batter.

{"sample_id": "5-2_10", "context": ["Hey there! I am so excited! I got pregnant!", "Congratulations! I am sure you have many questions now. What do you want to know?", "I heard so much controversy about breastfeeding. Is it really bad to do it?", "No, breastfeeding is not bad -- in fact, it's strongly recommended by health experts for both infants and mothers due to its many health benefits. According to the NHMRC, exclusive breastfeeding for around the first six months and continuing up to 12 months or longer provides clear benefits for both infants and mothers. These benefits include optimal nutrition and improved health outcomes in both the short and long term. Similarly, the UK GP Infant Feeding Network notes that breastfeeding plays a crucial role in infant wellbeing, maternal health, and secure infant attachment. They, along with the World Health Organization, recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months, followed by continued breastfeeding alongside solid foods up to 2 years of age or beyond. So, while there may be public controversy or social challenges around breastfeeding, from a medical and health perspective, it is highly beneficial and not harmful.", "What is the NHMRC?", "The NHMRC is the National Health and Medical Research Council. According to https://www.healthdirect.gov.au, it is Australia's peak body for supporting health and medical research; for developing health advice for the Australian community, health professionals and governments; and for providing advice on ethical behaviour in health care and in the conduct of health and medical research. Do you want to learn more about the NHMRC?", "No thanks. But do I need to change my diet?", "Are you asking for your pregnancy or when breastfeeding?", "Oh, is it different? Then first during pregnancy!", "It's important to eat a wide range of foods while you are pregnant, so better to not focus on jam, rice and cake. Some highly nutritious foods for breakfast are dairy products, eggs, fish, green leafy vegetables, sweet potatoes, fruits, nuts and seeds. However, rice is not bad. For example, Jasmine rice is packed with folic acid. Folic acid has been linked to promoting healthy pregnancies, especially when taken before pregnancy and within the first trimester. Specifically, regular folic acid intake has been linked to reduced levels of birth defects and neural tube defects, making Jasmine rice a good choice. Similarly, cake is not bad. Carbohydrates, which includes cakes, are an important source of folate, a B group vitamin needed for the healthy development of babies in early pregnancy. Folate is important to create DNA and new red blood cells. It helps in reducing inflammation and protects the hearts from cardiovascular issues. It also aids in regulating blood pressure. Also, your favourite juice, orange juice, has a lot of folates. To sum up, you do not need to do without the things you like, but you should mix it up with other healthy foods!", "What about jam? You did not mention jam!", "You might have heard concern on eating jam during pregnancy because jam contains pectin, which the FDA banned in 1992 in over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. However, the American Academy of Family Physicians still recognizes it as a drug safe for use in pregnancy, indicating that it is safe to consume pectin in the very small amounts in which it is present in jams and other foods.", "So what about breastfeeding?", "You don't need a special diet while you're breastfeeding - just try to include a well-balanced, healthy variety of the following: Fruit and vegetables, starchy foods (carbohydrates), protein, dairy. You said you are interested in low-carb diets, but a low-carb diet can be dangerous to breastfeeding moms and has been reported to be life-threatening. While breastfeeding you need to drink more than you normally would. It is recommended that nursing moms drink about 12 glasses of water per day to stay well hydrated. The good news is that does not all have to be water. There are many great lactation drinks that can help to stay hydrated and produce more breast milk at the same time. For example, coconut water drinks for breastfeeding, lactation latte, or the breastfeeding protein shake. Importantly, contrary to some beliefs, studies have shown that alcohol interferes with the release of oxytocin which affects the let-down of breast milk, which means that rather than increasing milk supply, breast milk volumes are more likely to be lowered by alcohol.", "Does this mean I could run out of milk for my baby?", "Yes, though most mothers can breastfeed and produce enough milk for their babies if they have the right information, support and care.

What else do I have to know?", "Some women get sore, cracked or painful nipples in the early days of breastfeeding. This usually happens if your baby isn't positioned or attached well at the breast. If a baby only sucks the nipple rather than taking a good mouthful of breast, then their tongue or roof of the mouth may rub on the nipple. Your midwife, health visitor or breastfeeding counsellor might be able to help identify any other underlying issues. Some women find rubbing breast milk onto their nipples can be soothing. Products like Vaseline or lanolin can help with dry or cracked nipples (although there's little evidence to show what really works well). After each feed, let your nipples dry before getting dressed - change your breast pads after every feed. Avoid using soap, as this can dry out your skin. If possible, only wear cotton, non-underwired bras. It's best to avoid using nipple shields and breast shells - these will not improve your baby's attachment to the breast. Try not to shorten feeds - doing so will not ease the pain and may reduce your milk supply. Moreover, you do not need to have your baby drink your milk directly. \"Expressing\" means taking milk from your breast without your baby suckling. You can use a pump or you can do it by hand."], "current_query": "That is good to know! Thanks, now I feel prepared to be a good mum and hope my baby does not need to cry.

Stacked Magnum are best suited for blending and shading smaller areas while Round Magnum are for colouring in larger areas without overworking the skin. Finally, Flat Needles are used for shapes and intricate shading, like geometric designs or bold lines.
