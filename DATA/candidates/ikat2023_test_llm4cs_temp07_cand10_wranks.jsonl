While BMI measures total fat levels, waist metrics focus on fat distribution. When used together, BMI and waist metrics provide a more comprehensive assessment of cardiometabolic risk. By considering both total fat and fat distribution, these measures help identify individuals at higher risk for various diseases.

Provided you've got a reasonably current smartphone model, neither iOS nor Android will leave you wanting. Android is hands down more affordable. Android is more free-wheeling which translates into a much wider phone choice in the first place and more OS customization options once you're up and running. You can get an awesome smartphone experience without breaking the bank. The iPhone has a very good feature that you don't need to think about stuff too much. This so-called \"walled garden\" approach gives you a great experience and, once you've learned a few of the ins and outs, iOS is intuitive and easy to work within.

By comparison, the iPhone X beat Apple's latest flagship devices by hitting 10 hours and 49 minutes in a similar test a year ago. Android smartphones smoke the XS Unsurprisingly, Android smartphones have a significant lead over the current iPhone generation. The first three places are occupied by Huawei P20 Pro, Google Pixel 2 XL, and Samsung Galaxy Note 9. Their batteries have more capacity than that of iPhones. The battery of the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max offers 2,658 mAh and 3,174 mAh respectively. In contrast, Android devices are equipped with an average of 3,500 to 4,000 mAh batteries.

The Xiaomi 12 will have almost the same triple camera setup with a Sony IMX766 50MP camera sensor as the main camera. This sensor has the same 1/1.56-inch big base, enables PDAF focusing, and has a slightly different aperture of f/1.75. Lastly, OPPO Find X5 Pro has an almost similar triple setup camera with a 50MP main sensor with f/1.7 aperture.", "Hmm, what is aperture?", "Aperture refers to the size of the opening in your camera's lens. When you take a photo, light passes through this opening and reaches the camera's sensor, creating an image. The aperture of the lens is adjusted to make it smaller or larger. This is done manually by you, or automatically by the camera, depending on which camera shooting mode you select. Use Aperture To Control Depth Of Field The main reason you'd want to adjust your camera lens's aperture is to take control of the depth of field. Depth of field refers to the amount of the image that's in focus - from front to back. A shallow depth of field means that only part of the image will be in focus. The rest of the image will be blurred. This is perfect for portrait photography where you need to draw attention to your subject. For example, the telephoto camera of Samsung S22 has an aperture of F2.4 Hence less light is passed through this lens compared to the lens of the main camera.", "Interesting.

HIIT stands for high-intensity interval training. It is a form of interval training that involves alternating short periods of intense exercise at maximum effort with periods of less intense exercise.

This pattern of alternating between high-intensity and low-intensity intervals is repeated for the duration of the workout.", "And how does it help?", "High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) has been scientifically proven to aid in muscle building. Studies have demonstrated that 3-6 weeks of HIIT can lead to increased muscle size and strength, particularly in beginners. For instance, overweight men and women who engaged in a 3-week lower-body HIIT program experienced significant growth in leg muscles compared to a control group. Similar results have been observed in other studies, indicating that HIIT is as effective as traditional weight training for promoting muscle gains. One of the factors contributing to the muscle-building benefits of HIIT is the increased production of testosterone, a hormone that aids in muscle synthesis. HIIT has been shown to elevate testosterone levels, especially in men. However, it's important to note that HIIT alone is not sufficient for muscle growth. Proper nutrition, including adequate protein intake, is crucial. Consuming around 1.2 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day supports muscle development. Incorporating weights into HIIT workouts, known as weighted HIIT, can further enhance muscle-building effects. Weighted HIIT, involving the use of dumbbells or kettlebells, has been proven to increase muscle size and strength, similar to traditional weight training.

Additionally, you can turn the rest periods into cardio sets by performing cardio exercises such as jump rope, jumping jacks, or burpees between weight lifting sets. This further increases the intensity and challenges both the muscles and the cardiovascular system.

{"sample_id": "18-1_15", "context": ["What are some different workout routines I can try?", "There are many different workout routines you can try to build muscle. Some popular ones include strength training, HIIT (high-intensity interval training), cardio, yoga, Pilates, lunges, pushups, squats, standing overhead dumbbell presses, dumbbell rows, single-leg deadlifts, burpees, and side planks.", "Can you tell me more about the second option?", "Do you mean cardio?", "No, I mean HIIT.", "Sure! HIIT stands for high-intensity interval training. It is a form of interval training that involves alternating short periods of intense exercise at maximum effort with periods of less intense exercise. During HIIT workouts, individuals engage in brief bursts of high-intensity exercises, such as sprinting or performing challenging exercises, followed by short recovery periods of lower-intensity exercises or rest. This pattern of alternating between high-intensity and low-intensity intervals is repeated for the duration of the workout.", "And how does it help?", "High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) has been scientifically proven to aid in muscle building. Studies have demonstrated that 3-6 weeks of HIIT can lead to increased muscle size and strength, particularly in beginners. For instance, overweight men and women who engaged in a 3-week lower-body HIIT program experienced significant growth in leg muscles compared to a control group. Similar results have been observed in other studies, indicating that HIIT is as effective as traditional weight training for promoting muscle gains. One of the factors contributing to the muscle-building benefits of HIIT is the increased production of testosterone, a hormone that aids in muscle synthesis. HIIT has been shown to elevate testosterone levels, especially in men. However, it's important to note that HIIT alone is not sufficient for muscle growth. Proper nutrition, including adequate protein intake, is crucial. Consuming around 1.2 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day supports muscle development. Incorporating weights into HIIT workouts, known as weighted HIIT, can further enhance muscle-building effects. Weighted HIIT, involving the use of dumbbells or kettlebells, has been proven to increase muscle size and strength, similar to traditional weight training. This hybrid workout combines the fat-burning benefits of HIIT with the muscle-building effects, providing a comprehensive approach. Additionally, the EPOC effect associated with HIIT, specifically intense interval training, contributes to fat loss and helps in achieving muscle definition.", "Can you compare it to strength training?", "HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) and strength training are two different types of exercises that focus on different systems in the body. Strength training primarily targets the muscles, while HIIT mainly targets the heart rate. However, this doesn't mean that HIIT and strength training cannot be combined or compared. While HIIT and strength training can be merged to some extent, it is generally recommended to work on them separately more often than together in order to target each aspect effectively. HIIT is known for its ability to elevate the heart rate quickly through short bursts of intense activity followed by brief resting periods. On the other hand, strength training involves lifting weights and focusing on muscle development.", "So they can be combined? How is that?", "To incorporate HIIT into a strength training routine, one approach is to shorten the rest periods between weight lifting sets. By reducing the amount of rest time, the heart rate remains elevated, providing a cardiovascular benefit alongside the muscle-building aspect of strength training. Additionally, you can turn the rest periods into cardio sets by performing cardio exercises such as jump rope, jumping jacks, or burpees between weight lifting sets. This further increases the intensity and challenges both the muscles and the cardiovascular system. It is also recommended to focus on compound movements during strength training, which involves working multiple muscle groups simultaneously. This can help raise the heart rate similar to classic HIIT. Examples of compound movements include push-pull patterns and alternating between different strength training exercises without prolonged rest periods.", "Thanks! What are some specific strength training exercises?", "Some good strength training exercises include squats, deadlifts, bench presses, rows, and pull-ups. These exercises work for multiple muscle groups and can help build overall strength. It's important to start with lighter weights and gradually increase the weight as you become more comfortable with the exercises.", "How are the first two different?", "The squat is a movement in which you lower your thighs to the floor until they're parallel while keeping your chest upright. Squats are also considered a functional exercise that mimics movements used in daily life, such as sitting down, picking up objects, or leaning down. On the other hand, the deadlift is a movement where you hinge your hips backward to lower down and pick up a weighted barbell or kettlebell from the floor.", "And which muscles does each target?", "Squats primarily target the glutes and quads whereas deadlifts target muscles such as the upper and lower back, glutes, and hamstrings. Deadlifts emphasize the posterior chain, including the glutes and hamstrings, more than squats.", "Thanks for that information. Now, what should I eat before and after?", "The best pre-workout meal is one that provides you with energy without weighing you down. As you don't have any dietary restrictions, I would suggest including a banana, a handful of nuts, or a protein shake. As for post-workout meals, consuming protein and carbohydrates is important to help repair and rebuild your muscles. Some good options include chicken and rice, salmon, or egg whites and bread", "But I don't like bananas.", "If you don't like bananas, you can also eat some other fruits like oranges or apples as an additional source of energy which digests fast before you start your training.", "What about supplements? Do I need to take them?", "Supplements are not necessary for conducting heavy lifts, and the objective gains/results are nominal at best. While many people swear by them and find enjoyment in their workouts with the use of pre-workout supplements, they are not essential. Dietary supplements, including pre-workout supplements, are not regulated by the FDA and should be taken at your own risk.", "How much protein do I need?", "The amount of protein needed to build muscle can vary depending on factors such as your weight, age, and activity level. The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight for sedentary individuals 1. However, endurance or strength athletes may need more, with recommendations ranging from 1.2 to 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight each day. It's important to note that consuming too much protein can pose health risks, so it's a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional before making any changes to your diet.", "Thanks!

It helps provide a clear and comprehensive response to behavioral questions. Look for questions that prompt you to share specific situations or examples from your past experiences. Use the STAR method to structure your answers. Begin by describing the situation or context of the example, including any challenges or obstacles. Then, explain the tasks or responsibilities you had in that situation. Focus on what you were responsible for or what the goal was. Next, discuss the actions you took to address the situation or achieve the goal. Provide specific examples and highlight your problem-solving skills. Finally, share the results and outcomes of your actions. Explain how your efforts contributed to achieving the desired results and any lessons learned from the experience. As an extroverted person, emphasize experiences where you've led teams, collaborated in group projects, and effectively solved problems through teamwork. Show enthusiasm for working with diverse teams at Google during the interview. By using the STAR method, you can effectively showcase your skills and experiences in a structured and compelling manner.", "Okay, that makes sense. I've worked on a lot of team projects and led a few too. But what if they ask me about any weaknesses or areas I need to improve on?", "It's important to be honest about areas for improvement. The goal isn't to present yourself as perfect but as a learner and a grower. Choose a real weakness, but one that you're working to improve. Show them you're proactive about growth. For example, you're working on becoming more comfortable with public speaking. This shows self-awareness, honesty, and a willingness to learn and grow. By acknowledging your weakness (public speaking) and discussing the steps you are taking to improve, you demonstrate that you are proactive and committed to personal and professional development. This can be seen as a positive trait by the interviewer. To summarize, the key to talking about your weaknesses is to pair self-awareness with an action and a result: What's the weakness? What have you been doing to improve? How has that improvement had a positive impact on your work?", "Thanks! Now, I'm wondering about what to wear for the interview. I know Google has a casual dress code, but I want to make a good first impression.", "That's a great question. While it's true that Google has a casual dress code, for an interview it's better to err on the side of formal. A good rule of thumb is to dress one level up from what employees typically wear. So, in this case, business casual should be a safe choice. You could go with dress pants and a nice shirt, for instance. How does that sound to you?", "That sounds reasonable. I'll stick to business casual then. Now, how should I handle a situation if I don't know the answer to a question?", "It's perfectly normal not to know the answer to every question. Not knowing the best way to respond to a question is not likely to eliminate you from consideration for a job. Recognize that other interviewees may also struggle with answering questions, and a solid but imperfect interview is often sufficient to move forward in the screening process. Maintaining a calm and confident posture when confronted with a tough question is crucial. Avoid panicking and remember that interviewers understand that nerves can affect performance. You can ask for additional time to consider the question or to clarify it if you didn't understand. It is better to admit that you don't know the answer than to make something up. If you are genuinely perplexed by a question, politely and briefly state that you are not sure. You can then spin it into a more positive response by mentioning that you will think about the question after the interview, do some research, or express your willingness to learn more about the topic if hired. If a key question stumps you, you can research and develop a strong answer after the interview. Including that answer in your follow-up communication shows your persistence, resourcefulness, and willingness to go the extra mile.", "I think that's a sensible approach. It shows honesty. Now, what if I give an incorrect answer during the technical round?", "In general, it's fine to make mistakes and take the wrong approach now and again, as long as you respond positively and are open to feedback. It's important not to get too nervous or let your mistakes affect your confidence. Interviewers are not only assessing your technical abilities but also evaluating your problem-solving approach, attitude, and how well you can handle pressure. Regardless of the outcome, it's always beneficial to ask for feedback after the interview. You can inquire about areas where you may have made mistakes or seek clarification on questions that you struggled with. This shows your willingness to learn and improve. Remember that making a mistake or giving an incorrect answer in a technical interview does not necessarily mean automatic rejection. Interviewers consider various factors, including problem-solving skills, attitude, communication, and cultural fit. It's important to stay positive, learn from any mistakes, and use the experience as an opportunity for growth.", "That's really helpful. How do I follow up after the interview?", "After the interview, it's always a good idea to send a thank-you note to your interviewer.

Examples of such questions include inquiring about the candidate's motivation to work at Google, how they would improve a Google product, their knowledge of Google's competitors, and their understanding of Google's history. Other questions may explore the candidate's ability to convince a client to transition to Google's cloud solutions, their opinion on charging Gmail users or for Google's productivity apps, and their views on the future of digital marketing. These questions help assess the candidate's critical thinking, problem-solving skills, knowledge of the industry, and alignment with Google's values and goals. It is essential for candidates to prepare thoughtful and well-reasoned responses to showcase their abilities and demonstrate their fit for the role and the company. Does this help?", "Yes, this is very helpful, thank you! How can I do well on this round?", "To excel in this round, the following tips may be helpful: First, familiarize yourself with Google's values and culture. Align your personality and career aspirations with the company's mission. Second, prepare for situational questions using the STAR method. Structure your responses by providing context, describing tasks, explaining actions taken, and highlighting positive results. Third, showcase your knowledge of Google products, including their features, competitive advantages, and areas for improvement. Articulate your ideas clearly and logically. Fourth, highlight your accomplishments and problem-solving skills. Discuss projects you're proud of, the challenges you faced, your problem-solving approach, and the positive results achieved. For example, you may talk about your research experience during your undergrad. Your research experience can demonstrate your ability to work independently, think critically, and solve complex problems. It can also showcase your ability to learn new skills and adapt to new situations. These are all valuable skills in a software engineering role. Fifth, demonstrate strong interpersonal skills. Emphasize your communication, problem-solving, creativity, leadership, and teamwork abilities. Again, here you may draw on your research experience. Share examples of conflict resolution within teams. By following these tips, you can position yourself for success in this round and impress the interviewers at Google.", "Can you tell me more about the STAR method? How should I use it?", "The STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) is a structured approach to answering interview questions using specific examples. It helps provide a clear and comprehensive response to behavioral questions. Look for questions that prompt you to share specific situations or examples from your past experiences. Use the STAR method to structure your answers. Begin by describing the situation or context of the example, including any challenges or obstacles. Then, explain the tasks or responsibilities you had in that situation. Focus on what you were responsible for or what the goal was. Next, discuss the actions you took to address the situation or achieve the goal. Provide specific examples and highlight your problem-solving skills. Finally, share the results and outcomes of your actions. Explain how your efforts contributed to achieving the desired results and any lessons learned from the experience. As an extroverted person, emphasize experiences where you've led teams, collaborated in group projects, and effectively solved problems through teamwork. Show enthusiasm for working with diverse teams at Google during the interview. By using the STAR method, you can effectively showcase your skills and experiences in a structured and compelling manner.", "Okay, that makes sense. I've worked on a lot of team projects and led a few too. But what if they ask me about any weaknesses or areas I need to improve on?", "It's important to be honest about areas for improvement. The goal isn't to present yourself as perfect but as a learner and a grower. Choose a real weakness, but one that you're working to improve. Show them you're proactive about growth. For example, you're working on becoming more comfortable with public speaking. This shows self-awareness, honesty, and a willingness to learn and grow. By acknowledging your weakness (public speaking) and discussing the steps you are taking to improve, you demonstrate that you are proactive and committed to personal and professional development. This can be seen as a positive trait by the interviewer. To summarize, the key to talking about your weaknesses is to pair self-awareness with an action and a result: What's the weakness? What have you been doing to improve? How has that improvement had a positive impact on your work?", "Thanks! Now, I'm wondering about what to wear for the interview. I know Google has a casual dress code, but I want to make a good first impression.", "That's a great question. While it's true that Google has a casual dress code, for an interview it's better to err on the side of formal. A good rule of thumb is to dress one level up from what employees typically wear. So, in this case, business casual should be a safe choice. You could go with dress pants and a nice shirt, for instance. How does that sound to you?", "That sounds reasonable. I'll stick to business casual then. Now, how should I handle a situation if I don't know the answer to a question?", "It's perfectly normal not to know the answer to every question. Not knowing the best way to respond to a question is not likely to eliminate you from consideration for a job. Recognize that other interviewees may also struggle with answering questions, and a solid but imperfect interview is often sufficient to move forward in the screening process. Maintaining a calm and confident posture when confronted with a tough question is crucial. Avoid panicking and remember that interviewers understand that nerves can affect performance. You can ask for additional time to consider the question or to clarify it if you didn't understand. It is better to admit that you don't know the answer than to make something up. If you are genuinely perplexed by a question, politely and briefly state that you are not sure. You can then spin it into a more positive response by mentioning that you will think about the question after the interview, do some research, or express your willingness to learn more about the topic if hired. If a key question stumps you, you can research and develop a strong answer after the interview. Including that answer in your follow-up communication shows your persistence, resourcefulness, and willingness to go the extra mile.", "I think that's a sensible approach. It shows honesty. Now, what if I give an incorrect answer during the technical round?", "In general, it's fine to make mistakes and take the wrong approach now and again, as long as you respond positively and are open to feedback. It's important not to get too nervous or let your mistakes affect your confidence. Interviewers are not only assessing your technical abilities but also evaluating your problem-solving approach, attitude, and how well you can handle pressure. Regardless of the outcome, it's always beneficial to ask for feedback after the interview. You can inquire about areas where you may have made mistakes or seek clarification on questions that you struggled with. This shows your willingness to learn and improve. Remember that making a mistake or giving an incorrect answer in a technical interview does not necessarily mean automatic rejection. Interviewers consider various factors, including problem-solving skills, attitude, communication, and cultural fit. It's important to stay positive, learn from any mistakes, and use the experience as an opportunity for growth.", "That's really helpful. How do I follow up after the interview?", "After the interview, it's always a good idea to send a thank-you note to your interviewer. This not only shows your appreciation for their time but also reinforces your interest in the role. It can be a simple email, expressing gratitude and briefly highlighting your excitement about the opportunity. Additionally, it's crucial to be patient while waiting for a response, as the decision-making process can sometimes take a while.", "That's excellent advice. I'll definitely send a thank-you note after the interview. What if I haven't heard back in a week?", "The Google interviewing process can be time-consuming, and delays are common. After interviews, interviewers need time to write up their notes, which can take up to 24 hours. The recruiter then reviews the interview report to determine if an on-site interview is warranted. This process may take several days, especially when multiple candidates are being considered. It is advisable not to rush with follow-up emails and to wait at least two weeks before sending another one. Remember that the recruiting process involves many candidates, and constant communication may not expedite it. If you haven't heard back after two weeks, it's acceptable to contact the recruiter and the sourcer you worked with. The recruiter should have been in touch within 48 hours of your interviews. However, delays can occur as the hiring process involves multiple stages and discussions within the hiring committee. If the recruiter provides feedback and wants to chat, it could be a positive sign, but it's important not to assume anything until you have a conversation. Speculating won't be productive, so focus on other tasks until you have that phone call. Patience is crucial throughout the process.", "Can I crack it in just 1 month of preparation?", "Have you done any coding before? Or taken a computer science course?", "I had a data structures course once back in undergrad. We learned the basics of C programming. So I know some basic coding and data structures.", "Cracking the Google interview in one month with only basic knowledge of C and data structures may be possible for some individuals, but it would require intensive, full-time study, and a strong grasp of computer science fundamentals, and algorithms. You could focus on mastering the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms, and practice solving coding problems on websites such as LeetCode or GeeksforGeeks. You could also go through books such as \"Cracking the Coding Interview\" to prepare for the interview", "That's excellent advice. Can you compare the two websites? Which one would be more suitable for me?", "According to some references, Leetcode is considered the best site for interview preparation, while GeeksForGeeks is more focused on theory and competitive programming. Leetcode has a comprehensive list of questions, good editorials, strong test cases, and a vibrant community. GeeksForGeeks has good theory content but is sometimes coded inefficiently, and their practice platform has weak test cases. In terms of community engagement and discussion, Leetcode is praised for its active and helpful community. For beginners, both sites offer a starting point with a list of top questions. Leetcode suggests starting with the \"Top 100 Liked Questions\" and \"Top Interview Questions\", sorted by difficulty level (easy, medium, hard). GeeksForGeeks also provides a collection of questions, but its list may be limited compared to Leetcode.", "Thanks! Now, would it be a bad idea to reschedule an interview?", "It would not be a bad idea to reschedule an interview for a software engineering position at Google. The general consensus among former Google employees and others who have gone through the interview process is that Google's interviewers understand that life happens and that candidates may need to reschedule for various reasons.
