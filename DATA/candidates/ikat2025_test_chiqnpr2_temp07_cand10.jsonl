Watermelon is considered good for acid reflux while pomegranate is not good because it is as acidic as citrus fruits. Do you want me to also list other food you should avoid?", "Yes.", "There is a long list of foods to avoid for acid reflux. These include fried foods, spicy foods, or fatty, rich foods. You may find that natural foods such as tomatoes, lemons, onions, garlic, mint, and cucumbers may also cause acid reflux symptoms. Many rich foods, such as chocolate and cakes, are also a trigger. Some non-citrus fruits like apples, grapes, pineapples, pomegranates, prunes, and plums. Some grains like white rice, wheat, corn, and rye. Some types of alcohol, such as white wine, are acidic and fizzy drinks, and even coffee and tea can cause severe acid reflux.", "Any suggestions to help me?", "The time and the way that you eat may be causes of acid reflux. Try to eat your dinner earlier because eating too late in the evening and going to bed after a big dinner is well known for causing acid reflux symptoms. If you are overweight, you are more likely to suffer from acid reflux symptoms. Losing some weight, taking some exercise, and adopting a healthier lifestyle may help reduce symptoms. Don't eat fruits like mango, pomegranate, and kiwi because they are not good for acid reflux.", "Cider vinegar? Isn't it acidic?", "It might seem counter-productive to add more acid to your already struggling system, but apple cider vinegar can make you feel so much better. Sometimes acid reflux can be caused by a lack of acid or lower amounts of acid in your system. Adding a bit of acidic apple cider vinegar can stop these problems before they occur. Combine 3 tsps or 1 tablespoon of raw, unfiltered, apple cider vinegar with 6-8 ounces of fresh water and drink before a meal. You can repeat before each meal or even 3-4 times throughout the day. Notes: If you notice that your acid reflux is worsening, discontinue this home remedy.", "Why does it happen? Does it have a reason?", "Acid reflux is a condition that occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter (LES)--a muscle between the stomach and esophagus-- malfunctions, allowing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus. This can cause a burning sensation in your heart and chest, which we often refer to as \"heartburn.\" Over time, prolonged acid reflux can cause damage to the esophagus and potentially lead to the chronic form of the condition called GERD. Acid reflux happens due to improper functioning of the LES. Acid reflux normally happens when we eat certain foods that stimulate excess acid production; however, for some people, genetics plays a role in reflux. Eating large meals, lying down straight after eating, or snacking close to bedtime are also common triggers of reflux. Being overweight means that you are more likely to suffer from reflux because of increased pressure on your stomach, which can force open the valve after a meal. Some people find that acid reflux is worse when they are stressed. Acid reflux also happens due to a weakness of the sphincter muscle, or when the stomach produces too much acid and not enough protective mucus. There is also something called a hiatus hernia; due to a gap in the diaphragm, parts of the stomach can move into the chest, which increases the risk of reflux.", "I have a deadline approaching.

These include a class of medicines called proton pump inhibitors. Some examples of PPIs available over-the-counter include: Esomeprazole, Omeprazole, and Lansoprazole.

PPIs block the final step of acid production by irreversibly inhibiting the proton pump (H+/K+-ATPase) in stomach lining cells. This leads to stronger and longer-lasting acid suppression.

Robusta's name comes from being more robust than the Arabica plants, which is why you can grow it in a broader range of environments. Therefore, it is less prone to disease. However, despite these advantages, it remains less popular than Arabica because its flavors and aromas aren't as desirable. Robusta beans are known for having a darker, earthier flavor, and for this reason, they are most often subjected to a darker roast to better match their natural character. Robusta beans also have nearly twice the caffeine of Arabica beans. While Robusta beans are generally considered lower quality than Arabica, this is not necessarily the case.

Arabica beans have sweeter and more complex flavors than Robusta coffee beans, which is why they currently dominate coffee markets, especially specialty coffee markets. Arabica coffee beans have a bright acidity, medium body, and multiple layers of flavor. They are well suited to be brewed pour-over style, which lets their subtleties shine more than espresso or immersion brewing. 2) Robusta is the second most commonly grown type of coffee bean. Robusta's name comes from being more robust than the Arabica plants, which is why you can grow it in a broader range of environments. Therefore, it is less prone to disease. However, despite these advantages, it remains less popular than Arabica because its flavors and aromas aren't as desirable. Robusta beans are known for having a darker, earthier flavor, and for this reason, they are most often subjected to a darker roast to better match their natural character. Robusta beans also have nearly twice the caffeine of Arabica beans. While Robusta beans are generally considered lower quality than Arabica, this is not necessarily the case. There are a growing number of farmers and processors working to develop high-quality Robusta beans and Robusta-Arabica hybrids. 3) Liberica beans make up only about 2% of the world's current coffee crop. Once upon a time, this varietal was far more critical after disease wiped out much of the world's Arabica supply. Arabica has since made a comeback, and Liberica production has primarily ceased. However, that may change in the future, as climate change makes it increasingly challenging to produce the more sensitive Arabica plants reliably.

How is the pain on those different areas?", "Yes sure. Most common climbing injuries actually come from pulley, sometimes with a loud \"pop\" and then significant swelling and pain. For A2 pulley injuries, the most common pulley injury for climbers, the pain usually arises at the base of the finger and is noticeable when trying to straighten or bend the finger. For A2-A4 ruptures, there may be bowstringing, bulging at the base of the finger, which can be detected by resisting finger bending at the fingertip. Those are usually associated with pain on the front of the finger. Otherwise, if you see difficulties with bending your finger, this can be due to damage on the tendon, it can be the case if you also have an open injury or a cut on the open side of your hand. Finally, if you feel that the pain is more on the side of the finger, then this might be the collateral ligaments of the fingers.", "I have pain in the front of the finger, especially when crimping, but I cannot see any bowstring, can this still be the A2 pulley?", "When you bend your finger, normally the tendon stays snug against the bone because the pulleys hold it down. In very serious cases, if you have a complete rupture of the pulley (especially A2), the tendon lifts off the bone, forming a visible or palpable \"bowstring\" under the skin. However, you can also have just a strain on the A2 pulley, with pain when crimping, which is less serious than the complete rupture, but still needs some rest. It is a good sign if you don't have a visible bowstring.", "I understand, what are the next steps?", "If you have pain in your A2 pulley as a climber, here is what to do next, depending on the severity of the injury: Grade 1: Pulley sprain. A partial tear of a single pulley. Solution: No need for immobilization. Begin gentle range-of-motion exercises, bend the finger until it feels tight, hold for 2-3 seconds, relax, and repeat 10 times for several sessions each day. Now perform the same exercise, only straighten the finger. Avoid pushing through pain. Grade 2: Complete A4 or partial A2, A3 tear/rupture. Either the A4 pulley is completely torn, or A2 and A3 are both partially torn. Solution: One to two weeks of immobilization with a finger-immobilization splint or a pulley-protection splint. Gentle range-of-motion exercises. If it persists, you can seek a diagnosis from a climbing-knowledgeable physician or orthopaedic surgeon, who can assess the damage with an ultrasound or MRI. This will help determine the level of care needed, as well as confirm and check possible damage to the rest of your hand.", "I don't think I want to do an MRI. Anyway, what are the risks if I don't rest?", "You risk damaging the pulley even more, which can be very dangerous and lead to surgery. From past patients that went through the surgery, most of them complained of reduced finger dexterity while performing their daily activities and work, and not being able to perform as they use to at climbing. This is not advisable. Even without going as far as the surgery, it can lead to a worsening of the tear, a bowstring, over-compensation from another part of your hand and risk of further injuries. Your body might also do inadequate healing with excessive scar tissue and limit your flexibility in the future.", "I will take it slow and take a few weeks off. What are some advice for when I start again?", "That's a good spirit. It is advised to spend the first weeks climbing relatively easy routes with big holds, good footholds and keeping sessions short. Stay away from overhangs and campus boards. You can return to full-force climbing if easy climbing yields no pain. Continue taping (it will also serve as a mental note of the previous injury) and avoid tweaky crimps and pockets for several months. Collagen supplements may also help the pulley recover faster by providing much needed building block nutrients. It is also good to re-start in indoor climbing rather than outdoor directly, as low temperatures increase the risk of injury.", "I don't like taking supplements. How to tape?", "Yes, it is totally understandable, many people prefer not to take supplements. When it comes to taping, it can be a helpful way to protect an injured pulley. Since taping restricts finger movement, it prevents you from using the injured area in ways that could make the damage worse, making it a generally safe and recommended approach. According to Dave Saunders, a physiotherapist and climbing injury specialist known for his work on hand and finger injuries in climbers, effective taping for A2 and A3 pulley injuries should limit the finger's ability to bend at the middle joint. To apply the tape correctly, note the three creases on the front of your finger, starting from the base. With your finger straight, begin taping from halfway between the first and second crease and finish halfway between the second and third, overlapping the tape by 50%. Once taped, you'll notice you can't crimp anymore, which is actually a good thing for healing. The goal is to restrict the range of motion at the injured joint so that crimping becomes impossible, protecting the pulley during recovery."], "current_query": "What about the H shape?", "predicted_rewrite": ["What does the H shape mean in taping techniques for finger injuries in climbing?", "What does the H shape mean in taping techniques for finger injuries in climbing?", "What does the H shape mean in the context of taping techniques for finger injuries in climbing?", "What does the H shape refer to in taping techniques for finger injuries in climbing?", "What does the H shape mean in taping techniques for finger injuries in climbing?", "What does the H shape mean in taping techniques for finger injuries in climbing?", "What does the H shape mean in taping techniques for finger injuries in climbing?", "What does the H shape mean in taping techniques for finger injuries in climbing?", "What does the H shape mean in taping techniques for finger injuries in climbing?", "What does the H shape refer to in taping techniques for finger injuries in climbing?"], "predicted_response": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}

Whether it's problematic depends on a few factors, including the intensity of the pain and the location. Can you tell me where exactly the pain is located? Is it in the pulley, the joint, or the tendon?

Three bones and three hinged joints make up the finger. Ligaments connect and stabilize the bones, while tendons connect muscle to bone, transferring to the bone any forces created by the muscles. Flexor tendons in the fingers attach to muscles in the forearms that pull on the tendons, bend the fingers, and allow us to crimp.

To apply an H-tape correctly, start with a piece of athletic tape about 4 inches long and the full width of the roll. From each end, tear lengthwise inward, stopping about half an inch before reaching the centre, so you are left with a narrow \"bridge\" between two tails. This creates the \"H\" shape. Place the central bridge of the tape over the palmar side (the inner surface) of the middle joint of the injured finger. Start by wrapping the two tails around the section of the finger closer to the palm (proximal phalanx), anchoring it firmly. Then, slightly bend the finger, about 30 degrees at the joint, and wrap the other two tails around the section of the finger beyond the joint (middle phalanx). This technique limits extension and flexion at the joint, providing mechanical support to reduce stress on the injured pulley while still allowing controlled movement for rehab."], "current_query": "Should I tape other fingers as well when training?", "predicted_rewrite": ["Should I tape my other fingers as well when resuming climbing training after my finger injury?", "Should I tape my other fingers when resuming climbing training after my A2 pulley injury?", "Should I tape my other fingers when resuming climbing training after an A2 pulley injury?", "Should I tape my other fingers while training again after my A2 pulley finger injury from climbing?", "Should I tape my other fingers while training again after a finger injury from climbing?", "Should I tape my other fingers as well when I start outdoor climbing again after my A2 pulley finger injury?", "Should I tape my other fingers when returning to climbing after a finger injury?", "Should I tape my other fingers when resuming outdoor climbing training after my A2 pulley injury?", "Should I tape my other fingers as well when I start training again after my A2 pulley finger injury from climbing?", "Should I tape my other fingers as well when I start outdoor climbing training again after my A2 pulley injury?"], "predicted_response": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}

Running shoes are specially designed for forward motion and repetitive impact, unlike walking or gym shoes, which may not give the right support. It's also important to choose shoes that match both the size and shape of your foot. Many brands offer different widths to make sure the shoe fits properly. Shoes that are too tight or too loose can cause discomfort or injuries over time. Always use shoes designed for running. Shoe companies spend years researching how to build shoes for specific activities, and wearing the right kind can help you stay healthy and enjoy your runs more. Would you like some advice on choosing some pairs?", "Yes please.", "There are many running shoes available, and they're often discussed in online forums. Here are a few popular options: 1. Saucony Endorphin Speed: A versatile, lightweight trainer featuring a nylon plate and PWRRUN PB foam, offering a responsive ride suitable for both speed workouts and long runs. 2. Hoka Mach 4: A cushioned daily trainer known for its lightweight design and smooth transitions, ideal for easy and recovery runs, though it may lack the responsiveness desired for faster-paced workouts. 3. Adidas Boston 10: A firm and stable shoe with a high stack height and energy rods, designed for longer runs at moderate to up-tempo paces, but may require a break-in period to achieve optimal comfort. I can give you more information about each of these models if you're interested. It's best to try them on in a store, as sizing can vary between brands. The right choice also depends on your running style and foot shape.", "Great, I will check this out. I want shoes that I can re-use afterward, not only running shoes, maybe multi-sports?", "For a multi-sport shoe that works well for both running and everyday life, the Hoka One One Hupana Wool is a solid choice. It's lightweight, around 9 ounces, with a smooth and responsive ride thanks to its RMAT midsole and outsole--a blend of rubber and EVA foam that offers both durability and cushioning. The design is more subdued than typical Hokas, making it versatile for casual wear. It's comfortable enough for all-day use while still providing the performance needed for runs or light workouts. Another good option is the Saucony Liteform Miles, which is especially travel-friendly. It features a highly flexible outsole made from Triflex rubber for excellent traction, breathable materials, and memory foam insoles for added comfort. It fits snugly without being tight, making it great for walking, running, and general gym use. Both of these shoes offer the versatility you're looking for--blending athletic function with everyday comfort and style.", "Now I am checking the plan you suggested, I will go on vacation for two weeks in January.", "I would suggest you with two options: 1. Go to a warm, running-friendly place. This will allow you to avoid the winter session, which is hard. 2.

According to the NHMRC, exclusive breastfeeding for around the first six months and continuing up to 12 months or longer provides clear benefits for both infants and mothers. These benefits include optimal nutrition and improved health outcomes in both the short and long term. Similarly, the UK GP Infant Feeding Network notes that breastfeeding plays a crucial role in infant wellbeing, maternal health, and secure infant attachment. They, along with the World Health Organization, recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months, followed by continued breastfeeding alongside solid foods up to 2 years of age or beyond.

For example, Jasmine rice is packed with folic acid. Folic acid has been linked to promoting healthy pregnancies, especially when taken before pregnancy and within the first trimester. Specifically, regular folic acid intake has been linked to reduced levels of birth defects and neural tube defects, making Jasmine rice a good choice. Similarly, cake is not bad. Carbohydrates, which includes cakes, are an important source of folate, a B group vitamin needed for the healthy development of babies in early pregnancy. Folate is important to create DNA and new red blood cells. It helps in reducing inflammation and protects the hearts from cardiovascular issues. It also aids in regulating blood pressure.

Your midwife, health visitor or breastfeeding counsellor might be able to help identify any other underlying issues. Some women find rubbing breast milk onto their nipples can be soothing. Products like Vaseline or lanolin can help with dry or cracked nipples (although there's little evidence to show what really works well). After each feed, let your nipples dry before getting dressed - change your breast pads after every feed. Avoid using soap, as this can dry out your skin. If possible, only wear cotton, non-underwired bras. It's best to avoid using nipple shields and breast shells - these will not improve your baby's attachment to the breast. Try not to shorten feeds - doing so will not ease the pain and may reduce your milk supply.

The collagen hydrates the skin cells, making them plump and full. This naturally shrinks the size of the pores, making your skin look flawless and beautiful. Additionally, microneedling addresses dark spots by breaking up melanin clusters and stimulating skin cell regeneration to produce healthy, unpigmented new tissue. CO2 laser treatment is recommended for anyone who is looking to do the following: Minimize the visibility of wrinkles and fine lines on the face. Reduce the appearance of sun-damaged spots, minimize the size of pores, and reduce the overall look and texture of the skin.

Recovery time varies depending on the peel's depth: light peels typically require about a week, while medium to deep peels may need over a month for full healing. During recovery, it's essential to avoid abrasive skincare products or techniques to allow the skin to heal properly, and extra care must be taken as chemical peels increase sensitivity to sunlight.

Learn about proper sterilization techniques and how to maintain a clean workspace.

Given your sedentary office job, getting into tattooing could offer a fantastic creative outlet and a more active, hands-on career.

One of the well-known European/German tattoo supply distributor where you can find high-quality cartridges (and other supplies) is Killer Ink Tattoo (UK-based, but ships to Germany). You can also check out local tattoo shops that might sell supplies or can recommend where to buy them. Many shops have online stores as well, which can be convenient.", "What is reach?", "REACH compliance refers to the European Union's regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals. It ensures that chemicals used in products, including tattoo inks and needles, are safe for human health and the environment. When a product is REACH compliant, it means that it has been tested and meets the safety standards set by the EU. This is particularly important in tattooing, as the inks and materials used can have direct contact with the skin. Using REACH compliant products helps ensure that you are using safe and regulated materials, which is especially crucial when you eventually move from practicing on fake skin to real skin.", "Ok. Anyway what is the best resource to learn about it?", "The Traditional Apprenticeship (or \"Ausbildung\") is the most common way to learn tattooing in Germany. It typically involves working under a professional tattoo artist for a period of time, learning the craft hands-on. Would you like to know more about how to find an apprenticeship or what to expect during one?", "What about online resources?", "Ah, got it! There are several excellent online resources for learning tattooing. Here are a few you might find helpful: There are many websites dedicated to tattooing that offer tutorials, tips, and forums for discussion. Websites like Tattooing 101 and Authority Tattoo provide a wealth of information for beginners. Websites like Udemy offer courses specifically on tattooing techniques, from beginner to advanced levels. Look for courses that focus on practical skills and safety. Joining online forums like Reddit's r/tattoo or dedicated tattoo forums can provide you with a wealth of knowledge from experienced artists. You can ask questions, share your work, and get feedback. There are also many books available on tattooing techniques, styles, and history.

First, the shape of the saddle really matters. Mountain biking involves a lot of movement and shifting positions, especially on rough or hilly terrain. A narrower saddle helps with maneuverability, while a wider rear provides better support for your sit bones. You'll want something that balances both. Also, durability and weather resistance are important, especially since you ride in the rain and on forest paths. Look for a weatherproof cover that won't get slick or degrade quickly in wet conditions. Saddle height and positioning also play a role in comfort. If you're riding cross-country, a slightly higher saddle can help with pedaling efficiency. For more technical trails or downhill rides, a lower saddle improves control. You might even want to consider a dropper post if you're doing both. Finally, padding isn't everything, comfort also depends on how well the saddle fits your body and riding style.

Riser bars give you a more upright position, great if you've had back pain, and a comfortable sweep keeps your wrists in a natural position. Handlebars are usually made of carbon or aluminum.
