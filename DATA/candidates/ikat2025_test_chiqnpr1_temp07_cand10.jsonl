You may find that natural foods such as tomatoes, lemons, onions, garlic, mint, and cucumbers may also cause acid reflux symptoms. Many rich foods, such as chocolate and cakes, are also a trigger. Some non-citrus fruits like apples, grapes, pineapples, pomegranates, prunes, and plums. Some grains like white rice, wheat, corn, and rye.

Notes: If you notice that your acid reflux is worsening, discontinue this home remedy.", "Why does it happen? Does it have a reason?", "Acid reflux is a condition that occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter (LES)--a muscle between the stomach and esophagus-- malfunctions, allowing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus. This can cause a burning sensation in your heart and chest, which we often refer to as \"heartburn.\" Over time, prolonged acid reflux can cause damage to the esophagus and potentially lead to the chronic form of the condition called GERD. Acid reflux happens due to improper functioning of the LES. Acid reflux normally happens when we eat certain foods that stimulate excess acid production; however, for some people, genetics plays a role in reflux. Eating large meals, lying down straight after eating, or snacking close to bedtime are also common triggers of reflux. Being overweight means that you are more likely to suffer from reflux because of increased pressure on your stomach, which can force open the valve after a meal. Some people find that acid reflux is worse when they are stressed. Acid reflux also happens due to a weakness of the sphincter muscle, or when the stomach produces too much acid and not enough protective mucus. There is also something called a hiatus hernia; due to a gap in the diaphragm, parts of the stomach can move into the chest, which increases the risk of reflux.", "I have a deadline approaching.

In addition, gingerroot tea, almond, chamomile tea, baking soda, and cider vinegar. Chewing gum helps increase saliva production and reduces acid in the esophagus.

Arabica beans have sweeter and more complex flavors than Robusta coffee beans, which is why they currently dominate coffee markets, especially specialty coffee markets. Arabica coffee beans have a bright acidity, medium body, and multiple layers of flavor. They are well suited to be brewed pour-over style, which lets their subtleties shine more than espresso or immersion brewing. 2) Robusta is the second most commonly grown type of coffee bean. Robusta's name comes from being more robust than the Arabica plants, which is why you can grow it in a broader range of environments. Therefore, it is less prone to disease. However, despite these advantages, it remains less popular than Arabica because its flavors and aromas aren't as desirable. Robusta beans are known for having a darker, earthier flavor, and for this reason, they are most often subjected to a darker roast to better match their natural character. Robusta beans also have nearly twice the caffeine of Arabica beans. While Robusta beans are generally considered lower quality than Arabica, this is not necessarily the case. There are a growing number of farmers and processors working to develop high-quality Robusta beans and Robusta-Arabica hybrids. 3) Liberica beans make up only about 2% of the world's current coffee crop.

Robusta's name comes from being more robust than the Arabica plants, which is why you can grow it in a broader range of environments. Therefore, it is less prone to disease. However, despite these advantages, it remains less popular than Arabica because its flavors and aromas aren't as desirable.

Robusta beans also have nearly twice the caffeine of Arabica beans. While Robusta beans are generally considered lower quality than Arabica, this is not necessarily the case. There are a growing number of farmers and processors working to develop high-quality Robusta beans and Robusta-Arabica hybrids. 3) Liberica beans make up only about 2% of the world's current coffee crop.

Three bones and three hinged joints make up the finger. Ligaments connect and stabilize the bones, while tendons connect muscle to bone, transferring to the bone any forces created by the muscles. Flexor tendons in the fingers attach to muscles in the forearms that pull on the tendons, bend the fingers, and allow us to crimp. Connective tissue encases the tendons, forming a sheath with five thickened areas that create the annular pulleys (A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5), which keep the tendon close to the bone when bending the fingers.", "Thanks, but please relate your answer to my pain? How is the pain on those different areas?", "Yes sure. Most common climbing injuries actually come from pulley, sometimes with a loud \"pop\" and then significant swelling and pain. For A2 pulley injuries, the most common pulley injury for climbers, the pain usually arises at the base of the finger and is noticeable when trying to straighten or bend the finger. For A2-A4 ruptures, there may be bowstringing, bulging at the base of the finger, which can be detected by resisting finger bending at the fingertip. Those are usually associated with pain on the front of the finger. Otherwise, if you see difficulties with bending your finger, this can be due to damage on the tendon, it can be the case if you also have an open injury or a cut on the open side of your hand. Finally, if you feel that the pain is more on the side of the finger, then this might be the collateral ligaments of the fingers.", "I have pain in the front of the finger, especially when crimping, but I cannot see any bowstring, can this still be the A2 pulley?", "When you bend your finger, normally the tendon stays snug against the bone because the pulleys hold it down. In very serious cases, if you have a complete rupture of the pulley (especially A2), the tendon lifts off the bone, forming a visible or palpable \"bowstring\" under the skin. However, you can also have just a strain on the A2 pulley, with pain when crimping, which is less serious than the complete rupture, but still needs some rest. It is a good sign if you don't have a visible bowstring.", "I understand, what are the next steps?", "If you have pain in your A2 pulley as a climber, here is what to do next, depending on the severity of the injury: Grade 1: Pulley sprain. A partial tear of a single pulley. Solution: No need for immobilization. Begin gentle range-of-motion exercises, bend the finger until it feels tight, hold for 2-3 seconds, relax, and repeat 10 times for several sessions each day. Now perform the same exercise, only straighten the finger. Avoid pushing through pain. Grade 2: Complete A4 or partial A2, A3 tear/rupture. Either the A4 pulley is completely torn, or A2 and A3 are both partially torn. Solution: One to two weeks of immobilization with a finger-immobilization splint or a pulley-protection splint. Gentle range-of-motion exercises. If it persists, you can seek a diagnosis from a climbing-knowledgeable physician or orthopaedic surgeon, who can assess the damage with an ultrasound or MRI. This will help determine the level of care needed, as well as confirm and check possible damage to the rest of your hand.", "I don't think I want to do an MRI. Anyway, what are the risks if I don't rest?", "You risk damaging the pulley even more, which can be very dangerous and lead to surgery. From past patients that went through the surgery, most of them complained of reduced finger dexterity while performing their daily activities and work, and not being able to perform as they use to at climbing. This is not advisable. Even without going as far as the surgery, it can lead to a worsening of the tear, a bowstring, over-compensation from another part of your hand and risk of further injuries. Your body might also do inadequate healing with excessive scar tissue and limit your flexibility in the future.", "I will take it slow and take a few weeks off. What are some advice for when I start again?", "That's a good spirit. It is advised to spend the first weeks climbing relatively easy routes with big holds, good footholds and keeping sessions short. Stay away from overhangs and campus boards. You can return to full-force climbing if easy climbing yields no pain. Continue taping (it will also serve as a mental note of the previous injury) and avoid tweaky crimps and pockets for several months. Collagen supplements may also help the pulley recover faster by providing much needed building block nutrients. It is also good to re-start in indoor climbing rather than outdoor directly, as low temperatures increase the risk of injury.", "I don't like taking supplements. How to tape?", "Yes, it is totally understandable, many people prefer not to take supplements. When it comes to taping, it can be a helpful way to protect an injured pulley. Since taping restricts finger movement, it prevents you from using the injured area in ways that could make the damage worse, making it a generally safe and recommended approach. According to Dave Saunders, a physiotherapist and climbing injury specialist known for his work on hand and finger injuries in climbers, effective taping for A2 and A3 pulley injuries should limit the finger's ability to bend at the middle joint. To apply the tape correctly, note the three creases on the front of your finger, starting from the base. With your finger straight, begin taping from halfway between the first and second crease and finish halfway between the second and third, overlapping the tape by 50%. Once taped, you'll notice you can't crimp anymore, which is actually a good thing for healing.

To apply an H-tape correctly, start with a piece of athletic tape about 4 inches long and the full width of the roll. From each end, tear lengthwise inward, stopping about half an inch before reaching the centre, so you are left with a narrow \"bridge\" between two tails. This creates the \"H\" shape. Place the central bridge of the tape over the palmar side (the inner surface) of the middle joint of the injured finger. Start by wrapping the two tails around the section of the finger closer to the palm (proximal phalanx), anchoring it firmly. Then, slightly bend the finger, about 30 degrees at the joint, and wrap the other two tails around the section of the finger beyond the joint (middle phalanx). This technique limits extension and flexion at the joint, providing mechanical support to reduce stress on the injured pulley while still allowing controlled movement for rehab."], "current_query": "Should I tape other fingers as well when training?", "predicted_rewrite": ["Should I tape my other fingers while training for outdoor climbing to prevent injuries?", "Should I tape my other fingers when training for outdoor climbing?", "Should I tape my other fingers as well when training for outdoor climbing, considering my history of finger injuries?", "Should I tape my other fingers when training for outdoor climbing to prevent injuries?", "Should I tape my other fingers during climbing training to prevent injuries?", "Should I tape my other fingers while training for outdoor climbing?", "Should I tape my other fingers while training for outdoor climbing?", "Should I tape my other fingers while training for outdoor climbing, considering my injury management?", "Should I tape my other fingers during climbing training to prevent injuries?", "Should I tape my other fingers while training for outdoor climbing?"], "predicted_response": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}

You can run casually for the time being but be sure to focus on targeted exercise when you arrive closer to the race. For the final weeks, the idea will be to run slightly faster than your lactate threshold and learning to sustain a hard effort when tired.", "How can I figure out my threshold?", "While exercising above the threshold, more lactate is produced than can be removed from the muscle. A reliable test method for the threshold is the talk test. If you are exercising and can explain easily to someone what you (for example) did on the weekend, you are below the threshold. If you have difficulty explaining, you are at the threshold. And if you can't, then you are above the threshold.", "I also don't have shoes.", "Running shoes are important because they directly affect your comfort, performance, and risk of injury. If your shoes are not comfortable, it can change the way you run and lead to problems like blisters, joint pain, or muscle strain. Running shoes are specially designed for forward motion and repetitive impact, unlike walking or gym shoes, which may not give the right support. It's also important to choose shoes that match both the size and shape of your foot. Many brands offer different widths to make sure the shoe fits properly. Shoes that are too tight or too loose can cause discomfort or injuries over time. Always use shoes designed for running. Shoe companies spend years researching how to build shoes for specific activities, and wearing the right kind can help you stay healthy and enjoy your runs more. Would you like some advice on choosing some pairs?", "Yes please.", "There are many running shoes available, and they're often discussed in online forums. Here are a few popular options: 1. Saucony Endorphin Speed: A versatile, lightweight trainer featuring a nylon plate and PWRRUN PB foam, offering a responsive ride suitable for both speed workouts and long runs. 2. Hoka Mach 4: A cushioned daily trainer known for its lightweight design and smooth transitions, ideal for easy and recovery runs, though it may lack the responsiveness desired for faster-paced workouts. 3. Adidas Boston 10: A firm and stable shoe with a high stack height and energy rods, designed for longer runs at moderate to up-tempo paces, but may require a break-in period to achieve optimal comfort. I can give you more information about each of these models if you're interested. It's best to try them on in a store, as sizing can vary between brands. The right choice also depends on your running style and foot shape.", "Great, I will check this out. I want shoes that I can re-use afterward, not only running shoes, maybe multi-sports?", "For a multi-sport shoe that works well for both running and everyday life, the Hoka One One Hupana Wool is a solid choice. It's lightweight, around 9 ounces, with a smooth and responsive ride thanks to its RMAT midsole and outsole--a blend of rubber and EVA foam that offers both durability and cushioning. The design is more subdued than typical Hokas, making it versatile for casual wear. It's comfortable enough for all-day use while still providing the performance needed for runs or light workouts. Another good option is the Saucony Liteform Miles, which is especially travel-friendly. It features a highly flexible outsole made from Triflex rubber for excellent traction, breathable materials, and memory foam insoles for added comfort. It fits snugly without being tight, making it great for walking, running, and general gym use. Both of these shoes offer the versatility you're looking for--blending athletic function with everyday comfort and style.", "Now I am checking the plan you suggested, I will go on vacation for two weeks in January.", "I would suggest you with two options: 1. Go to a warm, running-friendly place. This will allow you to avoid the winter session, which is hard. 2. Take a break, if your run is in April, you still have more than 8 weeks between the end of your vacation and your run, it's good to have a break before starting the training."], "current_query": "If I decide to change and go for a 5, instead of a 10, would the training change?", "predicted_rewrite": ["If I switch my training plan from a 10-kilometer run to a 5-kilometer run, what changes should I expect in the training requirements and plan?", "What changes would I need to make to my training plan if I switch from preparing for a 10-kilometer run to a 5-kilometer run?", "If I change my training plan from a 10-kilometer run to a 5-kilometer run, what adjustments should I make to my training requirements and plan?", "What changes should I make to my training plan if I switch from preparing for a 10-kilometer run to a 5-kilometer run?", "How should I adjust my training plan if I switch from preparing for a 10-kilometer run to a 5-kilometer run?", "If I switch from training for a 10-kilometer run to a 5-kilometer run, how should my training plan and requirements change?", "If I switch my training plan from preparing for a 10-kilometer run to a 5-kilometer run, what changes should I expect in the training requirements and plan?", "If I switch my training plan from a 10-kilometer run to a 5-kilometer run, how should my training requirements and plan be adjusted?", "If I switch my training from a 10-kilometer run to a 5-kilometer run, what adjustments should I make to my training plan?", "What changes would I need to make to my training plan if I switch from preparing for a 10-kilometer run to a 5-kilometer run?"], "predicted_response": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}

Products like Vaseline or lanolin can help with dry or cracked nipples (although there's little evidence to show what really works well). After each feed, let your nipples dry before getting dressed - change your breast pads after every feed. Avoid using soap, as this can dry out your skin. If possible, only wear cotton, non-underwired bras. It's best to avoid using nipple shields and breast shells - these will not improve your baby's attachment to the breast. Try not to shorten feeds - doing so will not ease the pain and may reduce your milk supply.

CO2 laser treatment is recommended for anyone who is looking to do the following: Minimize the visibility of wrinkles and fine lines on the face.

Recovery time varies depending on the peel's depth: light peels typically require about a week, while medium to deep peels may need over a month for full healing. During recovery, it's essential to avoid abrasive skincare products or techniques to allow the skin to heal properly, and extra care must be taken as chemical peels increase sensitivity to sunlight.

It's also a field where your ADHD might even be an advantage, as the intense focus and hyperfixation often associated with it could be channeled into mastering intricate designs and techniques. Are you more interested in finding a studio to learn from, or exploring tattoo courses and becoming self-taught?", "Self-taught. As a hobby for now.", "That's a great approach to dip your toes in and see if it's truly for you! When you say \"as a hobby,\" are you considering something like designing tattoos, or is it more about the actual application of ink?", "I want to apply ink. I already have a tattoo machine and some fake skin. Anything else I need to get started?", "Got it! Since you can draw well, you're already on the right track. In addition to your tattoo machine and fake skin, you'll need some basic supplies, including tattoo needles, ink, and a power supply for your machine. It's also important to have proper hygiene supplies like gloves, disinfectant, and a clean workspace to ensure safety and cleanliness while tattooing. For transferring designs, you might want to get some stencil paper and, optionally, a thermal printer. If you're new to tattooing, it might be helpful to start with some online tutorials or courses that cover the basics of tattooing techniques, needle types, and skin preparation. Practicing on fake skin is a great way to build your skills before moving on to real skin. Would you like more information on any specific aspect, like needle types?", "Yes please.", "Understanding tattoo needle types is crucial for achieving different effects in your artwork, even on fake skin. It's a bit like choosing the right brush for a painting! Tattoo needles are generally categorized by their configuration (grouping). There are Round Liners (RL), Round Shaders (RS), Stacked Magnum (M1), Round Magnum and Flat Needles. Round Liners are primarily used for outlining the design. They come in various sizes, affecting the thickness of the line. These include 3RL, 5RL, 7RL, and even larger groupings, with the number indicating how many needles are in the grouping. Round Shaders are designed for shading or colouring between the lines of the RL outline. Similar to RL, they come in different sizes, like 5RS or 7RS. Stacked Magnum are best suited for blending and shading smaller areas while Round Magnum are for colouring in larger areas without overworking the skin. Finally, Flat Needles are used for shapes and intricate shading, like geometric designs or bold lines. As a hobbyist, starting with a few common types like a 3RL or 5RL for lines, and a 7RS or 9M1 for shading, would give you a good range to experiment with on your fake skin. Focus on understanding how each type feels and how it deposits ink, and you'll quickly develop a feel for what works best for different design elements.", "Where can I get these?", "Great question! Always purchase your needles from reputable tattoo supply companies. Do not buy tattoo needles from general marketplaces like Amazon, as sterilization and quality can be questionable, even for fake skin practice. In Germany, look for suppliers that clearly state their products are REACH compliant if you ever consider using the same brand for real skin (though, as mentioned, for now, fake skin only!). One of the well-known European/German tattoo supply distributor where you can find high-quality cartridges (and other supplies) is Killer Ink Tattoo (UK-based, but ships to Germany). You can also check out local tattoo shops that might sell supplies or can recommend where to buy them. Many shops have online stores as well, which can be convenient.", "What is reach?", "REACH compliance refers to the European Union's regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals. It ensures that chemicals used in products, including tattoo inks and needles, are safe for human health and the environment. When a product is REACH compliant, it means that it has been tested and meets the safety standards set by the EU. This is particularly important in tattooing, as the inks and materials used can have direct contact with the skin. Using REACH compliant products helps ensure that you are using safe and regulated materials, which is especially crucial when you eventually move from practicing on fake skin to real skin.", "Ok. Anyway what is the best resource to learn about it?", "The Traditional Apprenticeship (or \"Ausbildung\") is the most common way to learn tattooing in Germany. It typically involves working under a professional tattoo artist for a period of time, learning the craft hands-on. Would you like to know more about how to find an apprenticeship or what to expect during one?", "What about online resources?", "Ah, got it! There are several excellent online resources for learning tattooing. Here are a few you might find helpful: There are many websites dedicated to tattooing that offer tutorials, tips, and forums for discussion. Websites like Tattooing 101 and Authority Tattoo provide a wealth of information for beginners. Websites like Udemy offer courses specifically on tattooing techniques, from beginner to advanced levels. Look for courses that focus on practical skills and safety. Joining online forums like Reddit's r/tattoo or dedicated tattoo forums can provide you with a wealth of knowledge from experienced artists. You can ask questions, share your work, and get feedback. There are also many books available on tattooing techniques, styles, and history. Some popular titles include \"Tattoo Bible: Book Two\" and \"Tattoo Bible: Book Three,\" which cover a range of topics from basic techniques to advanced artistry."], "current_query": "How long does it take before I can do it on real skin?", "predicted_rewrite": ["How long does it typically take for a self-taught tattoo artist in Germany to progress from practicing on fake skin to tattooing on real skin?", "How long does it usually take to transition from practicing tattooing on fake skin to applying tattoos on real skin?", "How long does it typically take to progress from practicing tattooing on fake skin to tattooing on real skin?", "How long does it usually take to progress from practicing tattooing on fake skin to tattooing on real skin?", "How long does it usually take to progress from practicing tattooing on fake skin to tattooing on real skin?", "How long does it usually take to transition from practicing tattooing on fake skin to tattooing on real skin?", "How long does it usually take to progress from practicing tattooing on fake skin to tattooing on real skin?", "How long does it usually take to progress from practicing tattooing on fake skin to tattooing on real skin?", "How long does it usually take to go from practicing tattooing on fake skin to applying tattoos on real skin?", "How long does it usually take to transition from practicing tattooing on fake skin to tattooing on real skin?"], "predicted_response": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}
