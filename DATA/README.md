# DATA: Candidates, Queries, and Topics

This directory contains essential data files for candidate generation, final queries, and dataset topics. These files are some of the outputs and resources used in our experiments. Below is an overview of its structure and purpose.

## Structure

- `candidates/`: Contains the outputs of candidate generation and ranking assessment processes.
- `queries/`: Stores final queries, such as the outputs from testing AdaRewriter.
- `topics/`: Includes test topics, training topics (datasets), and qrel files.

# Collection: iKAT and QReCC

We utilize two main collections: iKAT (ClueWeb22-B) and QReCC (Common Crawl and the Wayback Machine).

## iKAT Collection

The iKAT text collection is a subset of ClueWeb22 documents, prepared by the organizers in collaboration with CMU. These documents have been split into ~116M passages. The goal is to retrieve passages from target open-domain text collections.

### License for ClueWeb22-B

Getting the license to use the collection can be time-consuming and would be handled by CMU, not the iKAT organizers. Please follow these steps to get your data license:

1. Sign the license form available on the ClueWeb22 project [webpage](https://lemurproject.org/clueweb22/ClueWeb22%20Organization%20License%20(06.29.22.2).pdf) and send the form to CMU for approval (clueweb@andrew.cmu.edu).
2. Once you have the license, email Andrew Ramsay (andrew.ramsay@glasgow.ac.uk) to request access to a download link for the preprocessed iKAT passage collection and other resources such as Lucene and SPLADE indexes.

> **Note**: CMU requires a signature from the organization (e.g., university or company), not an individual. Please give enough time to the CMU licensing office to accept your request.

## QReCC Collection

To use the QReCC collection:

1. Download the collection:

    ```bash
    wget https://zenodo.org/records/5760304/files/passages.zip
    ```

2. Index the passages using Pyserini, a Python wrapper around Anserini. Java (JDK) is required as a prerequisite. After installing Pyserini, use the following command to build the index:

    ```bash
    time python -m pyserini.index -collection JsonCollection -generator DefaultLuceneDocumentGenerator \
     -threads 76 -input collection-paragraph \
     -index index-paragraph -storePositions -storeDocvectors -storeRaw
    ```

    > **Note**: For us, this took less than 2 hours.
