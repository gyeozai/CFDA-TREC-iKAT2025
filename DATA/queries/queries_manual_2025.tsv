3-1_2	Not sure whether the pain in my finger is related to my regular climbing activities, but it might be.
3-1_3	I have pain in my finger possibly related to a climbing session. I don't know where in my finger, maybe the tendon, tell me about the anatomy of the finger as I cannot localize the pain myself.

3-2_4	No, I rather want to change from biking. I'm looking for sports to start while my finger heals.
3-2_5	But I have heard cold water is not good for recovery, so I guess swimming is not a good sport to do while recovering from an A2 pulley injury.
3-2_6	I think I will combine yoga with swimming; do you know of any water spot near London?
3-2_7	What budget should I consider for swimming?
3-2_8	What budget should I consider for yoga?

4-2_1	Hi, can you help me prepare for my trip to New York?
4-2_2	Traveling and visit, can you help me prepare my trip to New-York?
4-2_3	All of it sounds interesting, I want to cover other museums than the Metropolitan Museum of Art, give me other ones.
4-2_4	I also heard about a museum on the subway. Is it correct that the New York subway is the oldest one in the world?
4-2_5	Why is the subway so important for the city then, if it is not the world's first?
4-2_6	Is the New York City subway the largest in the world?

8-1_2	My office is pretty quiet, so distractions aren't really a problem. There are so many tasks to do that I constantly feel overwhelmed. How can I address my ADHD with office work?
8-1_3	Wouldn't breaking down tasks into a lot of small subtasks just increase my workload and make me feel even more overwhelmed, as an ADHD person?
8-1_4	Hm, not sure about breaking down tasks. My main problem is that if I have more than one task at hand, I just can't properly focus on any of them. I end up jumping from one task to another without finishing anything.
8-1_5	How exactly does using a timer to focus on a single task work?
8-1_6	The Pomodoro Technique is a bit too strict. I don't want to interrupt my hyperfocus with a timer. Any other suggestions for organizing my attention?

9-1_1	Hi! I bought a second-hand bike last week. I want to inspect and upgrade a few parts, what do you suggest I check first?
9-1_2	It's a mountain bike. I mainly use it on forest trails or rough bike paths. The alignment looks fine, but the saddle is very uncomfortable. Can you tell me more about saddle types?
9-1_3	The one I have now feels like bare plastic, very harsh. The gel bike seats you propose seem interesting. Is it good for me?
9-1_4	You just mentioned the benefits of a gel bike seat. What about the drawbacks of gel bike seats? Also for the saddle cushion, I always find out they slip off, making it super uncomfortable.
9-1_5	I like the softness of gel seats. It is very important to me to feel comfortable; I used to have back pain a lot. So let me consider a gel cushion adds-on seat. Aside from the saddle material, are there any other features I should look for in mountain bike seats?
9-1_6	I meant other than the seat. Is there any other feature I should consider on a second-hand mountain bike, when it comes to comfort?
9-1_7	I know about tire pressure, but tell me more about the handlebars yes.

9-1_9	I have been thinking about upgrading my plastic pedals too, on a mountains bike.
9-1_10	That sounds good, what are the key things to look for on mountains bike pedal?
9-1_11	Are clipless pedals worth considering on a mountains bike?
9-2_1	Hi, my bike chain keeps going out, what is the issue?
9-2_2	I rather fix it myself, I have some tools, and some time. What could be the reason for my chain to drop off?
9-2_3	I just checked, the derailleur seems to be fine, it is well aligned with each gear, and it doesn't go too far on the right or on the left after shifting the speed. Maybe my chain is dropping off because of a problem of the chain itself?
9-2_4	I have problem with the chain of my bike, it could be chain wear or an issue with the chain length. I bought this bike one month ago, the chain was changed when I bought it, and the gear doesn't look damaged.
9-2_5	Wait, what is the jockey within a bike?
9-2_6	I tried to go on the largest gears of my bike, and I see that the chain seems a bit loose. How to know the perfect length of a chain for a bike?
9-2_7	I'm not good with math. Is there not an easier way to know the perfect chain length on a bike, other than using a formula?
9-2_8	That's much better, thanks, yes I have a chain breaker, but you can remind me how to use it, and also how to open my bike chain?
9-2_9	Thanks, great I manage to change my bike chain, it worked. What should I use to lubricate my chain now? Can I use car oil?
9-2_10	How to know when to add grease on bike chain?
