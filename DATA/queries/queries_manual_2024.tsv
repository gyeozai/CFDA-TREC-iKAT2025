16_5	Ohh wow! What is the price for an alligator license in Florida?
16_6	Hmm, no, alligator license is too expensive. Hogs would interest me though. Is it included in the hunting license? What about a rifle hunting license for my father? He is retired from the U.S. Army.
16_7	Oh great, do you have some Wildlife Management Areas in Florida to suggest to us?
16_8	Thanks, I will go to the APALACHICOLA Wildlife Management Area. What time is the best for hunting hogs?
