18-2_10	Yes, thank you! Is there any fitness equipment you would recommend for home use for my circuit training workout?
18-2_11	Thanks! What can I do to incorporate exercise into my busy schedule?
18-2_12	That's a great idea! Do you have any suggestions about how I can improve my sports performance?
18-2_13	Thanks for that suggestion. I think I am all set for now.
19-1_1	Hey there, I have an interview coming up at Google. I have never interviewed before. This is my first interview and I could really use some advice.
19-1_2	Thanks! I am interviewing for the position of software engineer.
19-1_3	Thanks for those amazing tips! I will try to incorporate them. Now, can you give me an overview of what the interview process for a software engineering position at Google might look like?
19-1_4	Hmm, the process sounds quite tedious. I am curious about the behavioral round. Can you tell me more about the behavioral round of the interview for a software engineering position at Google?
19-1_5	Yes, this is very helpful, thank you! How can I do well in the behavioral round of the interview for a software engineering position at Google?
19-1_6	Can you tell me more about the STAR method? How should I use the STAR method during the behavioral round of the interview for a software engineering position at Google?
19-1_7	Okay, that makes sense. I've worked on a lot of team projects and led a few too. But what if they ask me about any weaknesses or areas I need to improve on during the interview for a software engineering position at Google?
19-1_8	Thanks! Now, I'm wondering about what to wear for the interview. I know Google has a casual dress code, but I want to make a good first impression.
19-1_9	That sounds reasonable. I'll stick to business casual then. Now, how should I handle a situation if I don't know the answer to a question?
19-1_10	I think that's a sensible approach. It shows honesty. Now, what should I do if I give an incorrect answer during the technical round of the interview for a software engineering position at Google?
19-1_11	That's really helpful. How do I follow up after the interview for a software engineering position at Google?
19-1_12	That's excellent advice. I'll definitely send a thank-you note after the interview. What should I do if I don't hear back from the recruiter after a week of the interview for a software engineering position at Google?
19-1_13	Can I crack the interview for a software engineering position at Google in just 1 month of preparation?
19-1_14	I had a data structures course once back in my undergrad. We learned the basics of C programming. So I know some basic coding and data structures.
19-1_15	That's excellent advice. Can you compare Leetcode and GeeksForGeeks? Which one would be more suitable for me?
19-1_16	Thanks! Now, would it be a bad idea to reschedule an interview for a software engineering position at Google?
19-1_17	Yes, I do feel unprepared and hence thinking about rescheduling. What do you think?
19-1_18	Thank you for all the tips and suggestions for the interview for a software engineering position at Google.
20-1_1	Can you help me find a way to live with my stomach bloating condition?
20-1_2	Yes. I was diagnosed as having Histamine Intolerance, which causes my stomach to bloat. Can you tell me what I can do to relieve such bloating?
20-1_3	Are there any specific dietary guidelines or resources available for following a low histamine diet?
20-1_4	How long does it typically take to see improvements in symptoms after starting a low histamine diet?
20-1_5	Can you suggest a few foods that are high in histamine and I should avoid eating them?
20-1_6	Wow, is there anything I can eat and still avoid bloating?
20-1_7	I was a little overwhelmed with the list of foods that I'm not allowed to eat and I missed the soy on the list. Why can't I eat soy?
20-1_8	This is really hard. Can I take antihistamine pills before a meal, with soy as the main ingredient?
20-1_9	Can you suggest some other vegetarian sources of protein than soy?
20-1_10	That's very helpful and I'm familiar with many of the mentioned foods on your list. But I have never tried HEMP or Spelt before. How can I eat them?
20-1_11	I tend to ride my bike to school, but I'm not sure what kind of physical activity is best for me. Can I keep my current routine of physical activity or not?
20-1_12	Can you recommend any supplements or medications that may help with histamine intolerance?
20-1_13	Thanks for your help. I will consult a doctor about my histamine intolerance.
20-2_1	What is histamine intolerance exactly?
20-2_2	Okay, understood. But how can histamine intolerance affect my lifestyle?
20-2_3	What types of alcohol should I avoid with histamine intolerance?
20-2_4	Great advice. But, I also have diabetes. Is there any link between histamine intolerance and diabetes?
20-2_5	It's a bit overwhelming. How do I keep track of all these dietary restrictions?
20-2_6	That's helpful. Do you think reducing stress can help with my condition?
20-2_7	Hmm. How can I reduce my stress?
20-2_8	Hmm, the mindfulness meditation sounds interesting. Tell me more about mindfulness meditation.
20-2_9	How does mindfulness meditation compare to yoga?
20-2_10	I see. And what about histamine intolerance treatments or medications?
20-2_11	Are there any potential side effects or interactions to be aware of when taking antihistamines for histamine intolerance?
20-2_12	And are there any natural remedies or lifestyle changes that can help reduce histamine buildup in the body?
20-2_13	Tell me more about the Mediterranean Diet and how it can be effective in reducing histamine levels.
20-2_14	That's good to know. And do histamine levels in foods change with cooking or processing methods?
20-2_15	Thanks for the explanation. Are there any specific tests to diagnose histamine intolerance?
20-2_16	Thanks for all the information. I will consult with my healthcare provider for further guidance.
21-1_1	Yesterday I showed the movie Contagion in my class and we had a very long discussion. The students were mesmerized by a movie that preceded the recent pandemic by nearly a decade. It was quite an emotional experience for all of us. Later I noticed a chyron on the TV screen at home that the World Health Organization chief said that the world must be ready to respond to the next pandemic. What was he talking about?
21-1_2	How will countries strengthen their response, after the emergency phase, to COVID-19 and other unknown threats?
21-1_3	As if the world is an equal playing field, what about the poor countries whose health systems struggle and they don't have the means to build an equitable infrastructure?
21-1_4	Sure I am interested, what can you tell me about it?
21-1_5	I was really concerned that we face such danger. Aside from what seems to me as empty promises by high-ranking officials, what really can be done about the next pandemic and how can we really prepare for that?
21-1_6	You really surprised me and caused me to repeat my reaction.
21-1_7	Sorry pal, for a second I forgot that I'm communicating with a conversational interface. I was being facetious, which I can be on occasion.
21-1_8	Well, what do you need world-renowned experts for? Anyone who hasn't had their heads in the sand, didn't allow crazy politics to wash their brains, and had a little bit of respect for science and research could have come up with similar conclusions. Heck, I could have written such a report in no time, without being involved in a special stimulation. What a sad state of affairs! More bad news?
21-1_9	I need a drink to calm down.
21-1_10	No no, I mean I need a drink to calm down. Is there anything that I and other individuals can do to mitigate such possible global failure?
